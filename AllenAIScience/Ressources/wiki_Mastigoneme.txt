Mastigonemes are lateral "hairs" found covering the flagella of heterokont and cryptophyte algae. They are approximately 15 nm in diameter, and usually consist of a tubular shaft that itself terminates in smaller "hairs". It is believed that they assist in locomotion by increasing the surface area of a flagellum.
