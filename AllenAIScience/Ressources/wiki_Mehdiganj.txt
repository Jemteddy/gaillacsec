Mehdiganj is a village in the state of Uttar Pradesh near the city of Varanasi.


== Water problems ==
Mehdiganj has experienced a lack of water due to a lowered water table since about 2001. In 1999 a Coca-Cola bottling plant opened in Mehdiganj, and within a few years this factory has taken some or all of the blame from local people for causing the lack of water. There have been numerous protests by local people against this bottling plant.


== Lok Samiti ==
A Non-governmental organization named Lok Samiti is involved in many of the social services available in this village. In particular, Lok Samiti advocates for the government to give funding to the village people in the form of MNREGA aid, which is a primary source of income for many residents.
