Es bir, literally ice cold beer, is a non-alcoholic beverage in Indonesia. Visually it resembles a cold beer with dark yellow color and white foam.
Its color comes from powdered cinnamon and the foam is created when water, clove, cinnamon, sugar and ginger are shaken vigorously in a stainless steel tube. It is served cold and foamy in a big glass, much like a cold beer.
