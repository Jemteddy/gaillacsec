The Color Spectrum is the cumulative title of a project by The Dear Hunter consisting of a series of nine EPs of which each reflects an individual color of the visible color spectrum (namely Black, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet and White). This project was envisioned by frontman Casey Crescenzo as a way to interpret the colors of the spectrum via music, and is in no way related to the Act I–VI storyline, the band's main project. It was released on June 14, 2011.


== Background and recordingEdit ==
Brendan Brown (formerly in The Receiving End of Sirens with Casey) played bass guitar on the Orange EP. Jessy Ribordy (Falling Up) played mandolin on the Green EP. Naive Thieves helped with songs on the Yellow and Blue EPs. Andy Hull (Manchester Orchestra) provided vocals on tracks 1-3 on the Red EP. Tanner Merriitt (O'Brother) sang on "A Curse Of Cynicism".
On April 7, 2011, Casey announced via Twitter that The Color Spectrum was finished.


== Promotion and releaseEdit ==
On April 14, 2011, the band released a free MP3 download of "Deny It All" from the Red EP on their website. On April 26, Alternative Press debuted a lyric video for "This Body" from the Black EP, created by Casey.


== ConceptEdit ==
The Color Spectrum's influence is the subjectivity of perception and to a lesser extent the freedom it affords its viewer. Crescenzo remarks:

Anything we think of, we can do. Humanity's idea of colors is too broad. This needs to be more personal, because ideas of colors vary from person to person. Even for people who have synesthesia, the specific images or sounds they hear attached to colors vary from person to person. And that just reinforces the point of doing the project, to produce our interpretation of color, the way we feel about colors or are inspired by the colors – how we hear them or see them.
