Koren Specific Technique (KST) is a new method of non-invasive chiropractics developed by Dr. Tedd Koren in 2005. The technique allegedly uses patients' "occipital drop" to determine the location of patients' aliments. Chiropractors practicing KST use a device known as "Arthrostim" which claims to relieve tension, stress and issues on problematic areas in the body by delivering low-impact force based on Schumann resonances. The technique is considered to be gentle and safe. KST is derived from the existing concepts of Directional Non-Force Technique (DNFT) and Spinal Column Stressology.
The technique has been regarded as quackery due to lack of scientific evidence, though Dr. Tedd Koren disputes this claim. During the 1990s, Koren was under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission after an anonymous complaint for "false and misleading advertising". No charges were pressed and the investigation was subsequently dropped in 2001.
