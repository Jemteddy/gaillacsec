Displacement ventilation (DV) is one of the concept for the supply of conditioned air and ventilation of buildings. It is a room air distribution strategy where conditioned outdoor air is supplied at a low velocity from air supply diffusers located near floor level and extracted above the occupied zone, usually at ceiling height.


== Classification of displacement ventilation ==
According to the methods used to deliver incoming air, the DV systems are categorized into three different types: traditional DV, DV with a chilled ceiling panel, and DV with a raised floor by Chen and Glicksman.


=== Traditional displacement ventilation ===


=== Displacement ventilation with a chilled ceiling panel ===


=== Displacement ventilation with a raised floor ===


== System design ==
A typical DV system, such as one in an office space, supplies conditioned cold air from an air handling unit (AHU) through a low induction air diffuser. The cold air, with a temperature 2–4oC lower than the room average air temperature, accelerates because of the buoyancy force, spreads in a thin layer over the floor, reaching a relatively high velocity before rising due to heat exchange with heat sources (e.g., occupants, computers, lights). Absorbing the heat from heat sources, the cold air becomes warmer and less dense. The density difference between cold air and warm air creates upward convective flows known as thermal plumes. The warm air then exits the zone at the ceiling height of the room through diffusers, which can be located against a wall (“wall-mounted”), at the corner of a room (“corner-mounted”), or above the floor but not against a wall (“free-standing”).
Instead of working as a stand-alone system in interior space, DV system can also be coupled with other cooling and heating sources, such as radiant chilled ceilings or baseboard heating.


== History ==
DV was first applied in an industrial building in Scandinavia in 1978, and has frequently been used in similar applications, as well as office spaces, throughout Scandinavia since that time. By 1989, it was estimated that DV comprised the 50% in industrial applications and 25% in offices within Nordic countries. Applications in the United States have not been as widespread as in Scandinavia. Some research has been done to assess the practicality of this application in U.S. markets due to different typical space designs and application in hot and humid climates, as well as research to assess the potential indoor environmental quality and energy-saving benefits of this strategy in the U.S. and elsewhere.


== Applications ==
DV has been applied in the Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok, Thailand and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Flight Projects Center building, among other applications.


== General characteristics ==


=== Airflow distribution ===
The thermal plumes and supply air from diffusers, which determines the velocity of airflow at floor level, play an important role in DV systems. It is necessary to carefully set the flow rate from the diffuser to avoid drafts.


=== Conditioning type ===
Due to the unique properties of thermal stratification, DV is typically used for cooling rather than for heating. In many cases, a separate heating source, such as a radiator or baseboard, is used in during heating periods.


=== Contaminants ===
While a benefit of displacement ventilation is that air quality improves because contaminants in the air are able to leave the room, this assumes that all contaminants are produced by heat sources.


=== Energy savings ===
Some studies have demonstrated that DV may save energy as compared to standard mixing ventilation, depending on the use type of the building, design/massing/orientation, and other factors. However, for the evaluation of energy consumption of displacement ventilation, the numerical simulation is the main method, since yearly measurements are too expensive and time. Hence, whether DV could help with saving energy is still debated.In general, DV is attractive to the core region in a building since no heating is needed. However, the perimeter zones require high cooling energy.


=== Indoor air quality ===
One repeatedly cited benefit of DV is the superior indoor air quality achieved with exhausting contaminated air out of the room. Unlike mixing ventilation, displacement ventilation provides clean air to a room and removes contaminants created by heat sources in a room, resulting in an improved air quality.


=== Space limitations ===
DV is best suited for taller spaces (higher than 3 meters [10 feet]) in which large airflows are required for air quality purposes. Standard mixing ventilation may be better suited for smaller spaces where air quality is not as great a concern, such as single-occupant offices, and where the room height is not tall (e.g., lower than 2.3 meters [7.5 feet]).


=== Thermal comfort ===
DV can be a cause of discomfort due to large vertical temperature gradient and drafts. There is a tradeoff inherent in these two issues: by increasing the flow rate (and the ability to remove greater thermal loads), the vertical temperature gradient can be reduced, but this could increase the risk of drafts. Pairing DV with radiant chilled ceilings is an effort to mitigate this problem.


== Design guidelines ==
Different guidelines have been published to provide guidance on designing displacement ventilation systems, including:

== Researches ==
A number of researchers have studied the effects of DV in spaces. Mundt has focused on air quality, contaminants and convection plumes in DV scenarios. Nielsen has studied the temperature gradients and distribution in DV applications. Livchak and Nall have studied the possibility of DV in hot and humid climates. Loveday et al. have researched the issue of combining DV systems with chilled ceilings. Melikov et al. have conducted a field evaluation of DV.
