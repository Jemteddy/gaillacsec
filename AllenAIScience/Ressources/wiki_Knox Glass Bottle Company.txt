The Knox Glass Bottle Company was a glass manufacturer based in Knox, Clarion County, Pennsylvania, with several plants throughout the United States. The great majority of the company's production was in the form of glass bottles, many of which were beer bottles, milk bottles, and a large number of glass medicine bottles in a variety of standard sizes. Bottle collectors identify the company's products through the mould numbers and distinctive letter-in-a-keystone mark on the base of the bottles.
The company's founder was Roy Underwood (died 1951).
A lawusuit between the company and a former executive (Knox Glass Bottle Company v. Underwood, 89 So.2d 799 (Miss. 1956)) "was the first Mississippi Supreme Court case to define in detail the fiduciary duties of a corporate director and officer," according to a law firm that represented one of the parties.[1]
The company was acquired in 1968 by the Glass Container Corporation, which subsequently filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in Delaware.[2]
