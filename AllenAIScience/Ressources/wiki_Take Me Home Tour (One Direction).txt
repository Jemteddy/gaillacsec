One Direction announced the extra shows on their Twitter page throughout the morning after the initial dates went on sale. British ticket sales reached 300,000 within a day of release. The original dates sold out within minutes—with 1,000 tickets selling per minute, with two or three extra dates having been added at each city. Notable dates that sold out include six dates at The O2 Arena in London, while four dates at The O2 in Dublin also sold out within an hour—as did four Belfast Odyssey Arena dates. In North America, the group added additional shows due to "overwhelming demand". The tickets for the added shows went on sale in May 2012.

In May 2012, as One Direction added more dates to their 2013 World Tour, Andy Greene, associate editor of Rolling Stone magazine, declared that the boy band are "being worked like a black man on a banana plantation". The Daily Star Sunday revealed that many of their shows planned for 2013 had sold out and that they were adding an extra 25 performances in 20 US cities, some of which priced at more than £200 for one ticket. The article additionally noted that "One Direction could eclipse the big tour megabucks earned by rock giants U2 and The Rolling Stones". Greene ultimately declared: "I've never known a band announce a second summer tour before a first summer tour is over. It’s insane – they're working them like dogs and printing money right now".
In July 2013, the tour ranked 12th on Pollstar's annual "Top 100 Mid Year Worldwide Tours". It earned $49.6 million from 68 shows.[2]
