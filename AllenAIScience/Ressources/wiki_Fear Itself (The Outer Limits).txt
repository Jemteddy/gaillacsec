== PlotEdit ==
For as long as he can remember, Bernard Selden (Arye Gross) has been haunted by a paralyzing fear. It started when he was 6, when he set a fire that killed his four-year-old sister and today, at 27, the fear clings to him like a blanket. But, Dr. Adam Pike (Jeffrey DeMunn) has hope for a cure. He has diagnosed Bernard's condition and believes that if he can isolate the part of the brain responsible for fear, the amygdala, he can cure him. The series of injections and radiation designed to build a layer of calcium around the amygdala produces stunning results: Bernard's fear recedes. He even starts a relationship with his neighbour Lisa (Tanya Allen). But there are side effects. Now, Bernard can use his brain to make others feel the kind of crippling fear he used to feel. He is still a prisoner of the past, haunted by images of Mr. Wilkes (Alex Diakun), the owner of the foster home where Bernard's sister died. It is a terrible risk, but Bernard knows that if he is to be truly cured, he must go back to the day when the fear began and discover the truth. The truth being that he didn't kill his sister, Father Claridge did. He then unleashes his powers on Claridge, that allucinates being on fire, and passes out. Dr. Pike later reveals the amygdala has finally being closed and Selden is freed from his fear however Claridge is shown still trapped in his illusion, seemingly forever.
