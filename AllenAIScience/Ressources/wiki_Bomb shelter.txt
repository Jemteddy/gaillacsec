A bomb shelter is any kind of a civil defense structure designed to provide protection against the effects of a bomb.


== Types of shelterEdit ==
Different kinds of bomb shelters are configured to protect against different kinds of attack and strengths of hostile explosives.


=== Air-raid shelterEdit ===

An air-raid shelter is a structure built to protect against bomber planes dropping bombs over a large area. These were commonly seen during World War II, such as the "Anderson shelters" of the United Kingdom.


=== Fallout shelterEdit ===

A fallout shelter is a shelter designed specifically for a nuclear war, with thick walls made from materials intended to block the radiation from fallout resulting from a nuclear explosion. Many such shelters were constructed as civil defense measures during the Cold War. A blast shelter protects against more conventional bomb blasts. Its main purpose is to protect from shock waves and overpressure.


=== BunkerEdit ===

While these forms of bomb shelters are equally amenable to civilian and military use, a bunker is more commonly associated with military use. A bunker may be hastily assembled as part of an ongoing military advance, or to hold a line. Bunkers have also been popular with the Survivalism subculture.

A dictionary from that year defines a "casement" as "a bomb-proof shelter for soldiers in garrison". In 1881, the United States War Department issued a report in which it indicated that the defenses of Charleston, South Carolina included construction at Fort Moultrie of:
The shortening of this phrase to the conventional "bomb shelter" appears in print at least as early as 1895.
