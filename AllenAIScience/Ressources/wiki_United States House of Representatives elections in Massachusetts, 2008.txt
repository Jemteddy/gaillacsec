The 2008 congressional elections in Massachusetts were held on November 4, 2008 to determine who will represent the U.S. state of Massachusetts in the United States House of Representatives. Representatives are elected for two-year terms; whoever is elected will serve in the 111th Congress from January 4, 2009 until January 3, 2011. The election coincides with the 2008 U.S. presidential election.
Massachusetts has ten seats in the House, apportioned according to the 2000 United States Census. Its 2007-2008 congressional delegation consisted of ten Democrats. This remains unchanged, and CQ Politics had forecasted all districts safe for its Democratic incumbent.
