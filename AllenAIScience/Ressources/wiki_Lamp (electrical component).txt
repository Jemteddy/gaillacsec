A lamp is a replaceable component that produces light from electricity. Compact lamps are commonly called light bulbs; for example, the incandescent light bulb. Lamps usually have a base made of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which secures the lamp in the socket of a light fixture. The electrical connection to the socket may be made with a screw-thread base, two metal pins, two metal caps or a bayonet cap.


== Types ==
There are several types of lamp:
Incandescent lamp, a heated filament inside a glass envelope
Halogen lamps use a fused quartz envelope, filled with halogen gas

LED lamp, a solid-state lamp that uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the source of light
Arc lamp
Xenon arc lamp
Mercury-xenon arc lamp
Ultra-high-performance lamp, an ultra-high-pressure mercury-vapor arc lamp for use in projectors
Metal-halide lamp

Gas-discharge lamp, a light source that generates light by sending an electrical discharge through an ionized gas
Fluorescent lamp
Compact fluorescent lamp, a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent lamp

Neon lamp
Mercury-vapor lamp
Sodium-vapor lamp
Sulfur lamp
Electrodeless lamp, a gas discharge lamp in which the power is transferred from outside the bulb to inside via electromagnetic fields


== Uses other than illumination ==

Lamps can be used as heat sources, for example in incubators and toys such as the Easy-Bake Oven.
Filament lamps have long been used as fast acting thermistors in electronic circuits. The filaments are most likely made out of tungsten. Popular uses have included:
Stabilisation of sine wave oscillators
Protection of tweeters
Automatic volume control in telephones


== Lamp circuit symbols ==
In circuit diagrams lamps usually are shown as symbols. There are two main types of symbols, these are:
