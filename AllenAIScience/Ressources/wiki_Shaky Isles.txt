The Shaky Isles or Shaky Islands is a nickname for New Zealand. At one time this nickname was used in New Zealand itself, though it's usage there is now seen as dated; it is still fairly widely used in Australia.
The term derived from New Zealand's frequent seismic activity. The islands lie on the margin of two colliding tectonic plates, the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates. Earthquakes are common, particularly in the southwest of the South Island and in the central North Island, and the North Island's scenery is marked by several active and dormant volcanic cones.
The phrase is at worst only very mildly derogatory, and is usually only used humorously with no pejorative connotations.
The country records more than 14,000 earthquakes a year â€“ but only about 150 are usually felt. Schoolchildren in the country regularly undertake earthquake drills.
