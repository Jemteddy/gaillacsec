One Year is the debut album by singer Colin Blunstone, member of the British rock band, The Zombies. It was released in 1971 (see 1971 in music). Two singles — "Caroline, Goodbye" b/w "Though You Are Far Away" followed by "Say You Don't Mind" b/w "Let Me Come Closer" — were issued with the second one reaching number 15 in the UK. One Year was reissued on CD by Sony in 2002 and by Water Records in 2007.
After the Zombies disbanded in 1968, Blunstone left the music business only to return after the surprise success of "Time of the Season". One Year was co-produced by Blunstone's former Zombie colleagues Rod Argent and Chris White who also contributed three songs to the album. "Caroline Goodbye" and "Mary Won't You Warm My Bed" were arranged by Rod Argent and Tony Visconti. John Fiddy arranged "Let Me Come Closer to You". The rest of the album was arranged by Chris Gunning.

Music critic Robin Platts of Allmusic wrote: "Widely considered to be Blunstone's best solo album, One Year is the perfect showcase for his distinctive, breathy voice. He also came into his own as a songwriter on this record."
