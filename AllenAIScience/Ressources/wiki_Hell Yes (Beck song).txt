"Hell Yes" is a song by Beck, released as the third and final single from his 2005 album Guero. A remix version by 8-Bit entitled "Ghettochip Malfunction (Hell Yes)" appears on the Hell Yes EP and Guerolito and was released as a single. Christina Ricci provides the Japanese female voice in the track. Beck sampled funk band Ohio Players' 1976 Contradiction track "Far East Mississippi" for this song.


== Music video ==
The music video for "Hell Yes" features four QRIOs, developed by Sony Japan. The QRIO is designed to carry on conversations, adapt to its environment, and mimic human movements, including dance routines. Shots of Beck performing this song are imposed on the wall behind the QRIOs. At the time of the video shoot, there were only four working QRIOs in the world â€” all of which appear in this video. The video was directed by Garth Jennings.
