Kirkpatrick-Fleming is a village and civil parish in Dumfries and Galloway, south-west Scotland. It is located around 5.5 kilometres (3.4 mi) north-west of Gretna, and 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) west of Annan, between the Kirtle Water and the A74(M) motorway. From the village road, the Solway Firth, and the Cumbrian hills are visible. It also has little light pollution, affording good views of the night sky.
The name is derived from the parish church, dedicated to St Patrick, and the Fleming family, the local landowners who resided at Redhall. The medieval parish church was given to Gisborough Priory in Cleveland by Robert de Brus, Lord of Annandale, around 1170, though this connection lapsed after 1330. The present church dates to the 18th century and is protected as a category B listed building.
The village was served by Kirkpatrick railway station on the old Caledonian Railway main line from 1847 to 1960.
It has one pub, the Station Inn, which serves meals (closed Mondays).
It also has a caravan and camping site, Bruces Cave, which boasts a cave allegedly used by King Robert the Bruce, giving rise to the "if at first you don't succeed" saying, by him watching the spiders spinning their webs.
