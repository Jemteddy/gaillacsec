In human mitochondrial genetics, Haplogroup CZ is a human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup.


== Origin ==
Haplogroup CZ is a descendant of haplogroup M and is a parent to haplogroups C and Z. Haplogroup CZ is divided into subclades C and Z, which share a common ancestor approximately 45,000 years ago.


== Distribution ==
Today CZ is found in eastern Eurasian populations. It is most common in Siberian populations. It is recognized by the genetic marker at 249d.


== Subclades ==


=== Tree ===
This phylogenetic tree of haplogroup CZ subclades is based on the paper by Mannis van Oven and Manfred Kayser Updated comprehensive phylogenetic tree of global human mitochondrial DNA variation and subsequent published research.
