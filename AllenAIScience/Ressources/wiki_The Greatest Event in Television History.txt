The Greatest Event in Television History is a mockumentary television series created by Adam Scott and Naomi Sablan. The series premiered on Cartoon Network's late night programming block Adult Swim on October 12, 2012 and ended on January 23, 2014 with a total of four episodes. Each episode originally aired independently as a special presentation, with several months between the broadcast of each episode.


== FormatEdit ==
The format of each special is a brief mockumentary about the shot-for-shot remake of a 1980s TV series opening credits sequence, followed by the remake itself. Series cocreator Adam Scott says the specials are at least in part motivated by his own memories of watching '80s TV as a kid. The overall program is hosted by Jeff Probst with other actors portraying fictional versions of themselves. After each episode, the original opening credit scene is shown.


== ProductionEdit ==
Four episodes were produced during the show's run; the series finale aired on January 23, 2014. In an interview with Splitsider, Scott explained the conclusion of the series: "It's a lot of work for such a short, stupid thing... they're really fun and they're fun to make, but we're ready to move on."
