^ Gallatin won election to the Senate in 1793, and took the oath of office, but on the same day a petition was filed by nineteen Pennsylvania Federalists protesting that Gallatin did not have the minimum nine years of citizenship required to be a Senator. After two months of deliberation, the matter went before a Senate vote where Gallatin was removed from the Senate with a party-line vote of 14–12.
