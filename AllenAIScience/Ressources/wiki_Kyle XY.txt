Kyle XY is an American science fiction television series produced by ABC Family. The central character is a teenage boy (Matt Dallas) who awakens naked in a forest outside Seattle, Washington, with no more knowledge or abilities than a newborn and no belly button. He is taken in by a family and given the name Kyle. The series follows Kyle as he tries to solve the puzzles of who he is and why he has no memory before that day. Although set in present-day Seattle, the series was filmed in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area.
The show premiered June 26, 2006, on the ABC Family cable channel. Episodes were also broadcast on the ABC network the first season, but only for part of the second season, after which it could only be seen on ABC Family.
After the 10-episode debut season on ABC Family during summer 2006, news reported a total of 23 new episodes were ordered for the second season, which started on June 11, 2007, with rebroadcasts on ABC beginning on June 15, 2007. The second season’s 13th episode, "Leap of Faith", aired on Monday, September 3, 2007; the remaining 10 began airing on January 12, 2008.
The German version was aired December 8, 2007. The show started its second season in the UK on Monday, September 3, 2007, and on April 5, the first season was broadcast in France on M6. On October 5, 2007, TV Guide reported that ABC family had renewed Kyle XY for a third season of 10 episodes, which began airing on January 12, 2009.
On January 31, 2009, ABC Family announced that Kyle XY would not return for a fourth season. The season finale of the show aired on Monday, March 16, 2009, at 9/8c on ABC Family, leaving several unresolved dramatic cliffhangers. Following the last episode, writer Julie Plec revealed what had been planned for further seasons. She also noted that the season three DVD would contain a "mini wrap-up" feature for the series. The "wrap-up" is called "Kyle XY: Future Revealed", with the writers and actors explaining their plans for future episodes and what would have ultimately happened in the series.


== Season 1Edit ==
A boy wakens in the woods, naked and covered in pink goo. He is completely innocent even though his mind works at a mile a minute. When he wanders into the nearby city he is detained by police and sent to a juvenile detention center as a John Doe. A psychologist (Nicole Trager) is sent for by the center to deal with his extensive amnesia (he doesn't remember a thing before waking in the woods) and she becomes his foster mother. With the boy's assistance they decide a name for him, Kyle. He is brought to the Trager's home to settle in, gaining an entire family and learning to speak. As the summer progresses he begins to learn how to function in society and shows enhanced physicality, senses and intellect. Repressed memories begin to seep through and when he sees or remembers anything of import to him he makes a picture of nearly snapshot quality with pointillism. Of particular interest is a neighbor girl (Amanda) who becomes his first crush. He isn't very sure of how to act with her having seen the relationship attempts and fumbles of his foster siblings. When school begins he has difficulty on the first day but soon makes a place for himself in spite of a negative vice principal. He continues to have run-ins with a creepy security guard who has the family under surveillance, Tom Foss. Eventually he learns that Foss is trying to protect him from a murky past involving a highly secretive company (Zzyzx) and a grad student who has been missing for over twenty years (Adam Baylin). After Kyle and Foss rescue each other in an assassination attempt by Zzyzx he leaves with a supposed birth family, Julia and David Peterson, and is brought to see the reclusive Baylin.

== RatingsEdit ==
Kyle XY was ABC Family channel’s highest rated original series from June 2006 to July 2008. The show lost its reign when the series premiere of The Secret Life of the American Teenager brought in 2.8 million viewers. According to the same press release, Kyle XY received a household rating of 2.1 and reached 2.6 million viewers. The repeat showing of the first episode on sister broadcast network ABC had more than 5.2 million viewers. Several news sources said low ratings is one of the reasons for the series' cancellation.
The third season premiere (in a new time slot, with high-viewership lead-in The Secret Life of the American Teenager) was 1.5 million total viewers, down 33 percent from the Season 2 opener, and most ABC Family shows significantly outperformed the show. The second episode slid to 1.426 million viewers.

== Alternate reality gameEdit ==
Kyle XY as a series also features an alternate reality game where the players are "invited" to help solve the mystery of who Kyle really is. The Mada Corporation website is the game's rabbit hole — the introduction to the game universe. By clicking on "Our Jobs" in the menu, the gamer is taken to an anti-Madacorp Blog, where clues are left for revealing the truth about Kyle. It has been removed since the premiere of Season 2 and the Mada Corporation Website has been completely re-done to act as a real working website. The game also makes use of the website for a group called "The Latnok Society" and a brand new clue tracker room, which is more interactive than the previous one.
