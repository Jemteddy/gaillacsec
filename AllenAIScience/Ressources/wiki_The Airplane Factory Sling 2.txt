The Airplane Factory Sling 2 is a South African two-seater light aircraft designed and produced by The Airplane Factory in Johannesburg, South Africa. In 2009 the specially modified second prototype was flown around the world in a westerly circumnavigation which took 40 days. This was the first time any aircraft of this class had achieved a circumnavigation. The design complies with the requirements of four different regulatory aircraft classes.
The Sling 2 is supplied as a kit and as a ready-to-fly aircraft and can be operated as a Light-sport Aircraft or homebuilt aircraft.


== Design and Development ==
Development of the Sling 2 commenced in 2006. The Sling is a two-seat, low wing, all metal aircraft with tricycle landing gear made from composites. The aircraft is powered by a 100 hp (75 kW) Rotax 912 ULS engine which drives a 3-bladed Warp Drive Inc propeller. The airplane features a sliding canopy, large fuel tanks, and standard equipment includes a "glass cockpit" style display.
Mike Blyth began working on the design of the Sling 2 in 2006. The first prototype was completed in 2008, the Sling made its first flight on November 18, 2008. A full testing programme followed, with the help of a South African military aerodynamicist, which was completed in 2009. Blyth and partner James Pitman then flew the 2nd prototype around the world to accomplish a challenging circumnavigation.
Sixty Sling 2s had been completed and flown by the end of 2012. The aircraft is now known as "Sling 2" to distinguish it from the more recent four-seat Sling 4, also in production.


== Operational history ==
The second prototype Sling 2 was flown on a westerly global circumnavigation in 2009. Blyth and Pitman departed from South Africa flying up through Western Africa, across the Atlantic to Brazil and Guyana, up through the US Virgin Islands and the East Coast of the United States to Oshkosh, Wisconsin for EAA AirVenture Oshkosh 2009. After the air show they flew across the United States to Los Angeles, then on to Hawaii, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Seychelles, and finally back to South Africa. They completed the whole journey in 40 days. The aircraft used for the circumnavigation was a standard production Sling, but with larger 118.8 U.S. gallons (450 L; 98.9 imp gal) fuel tanks, strengthened landing gear, seats that lie flat for sleeping and removable control sticks. After being modified, the aircraft had an endurance at standard cruise of approximately 24 hours. The aircraft cruised at 89 knots Indicated airspeed (IAS) (98 knots True airspeed (TAS) with almost full fuel. When more nearly empty, it would cruise at 96 knots IAS (105 knots TAS). With full fuel, fully loaded with crew the Sling weighed approximately 1,984 Lbs (900 kg), or about 600 pounds overweight. At sea level the aircraft would climb slowly, at a rate of 350 feet per minute.
