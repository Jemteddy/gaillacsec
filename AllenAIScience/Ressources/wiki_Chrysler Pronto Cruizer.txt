The Chrysler Pronto Cruizer was a concept car designed by Bryan Nesbitt for Chrysler — a design that ultimately evolved into the Chrysler PT Cruiser.
The Pronto Cruizer debuted at the 1999 Geneva Auto Show as a possible Plymouth model — as with other "Pronto" concepts, the 1997 Plymouth Pronto and 1998 Plymouth Pronto Spyder). The Pronto Cruizer became a Chrysler due to the planned discontinuation of the Plymouth marque.
The vehicle carried a 1.6 L I4 engine with a five-speed manual transmission borrowed from the second generation Dodge/Plymouth Neon. The design was also derived from the Neon, but with elements borrowed from another DaimlerChrysler concept car, the Plymouth Pronto. The Pronto Cruizer had a grille and fenders that rivaled the one used on the unique Plymouth Prowler. A roll-back fabric top was used on the Pronto Cruizer as well.
The Pronto Cruizer was recreated as a scale model by Maisto, reproduced first as a 1:18 scale model with an Aztec Yellow paint job. Later, another scale model of the Pronto Cruizer was released by Maisto, this time having a theme from Marvel's Incredible Hulk.
