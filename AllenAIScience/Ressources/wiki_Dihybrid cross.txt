Dihybrid cross is a cross between two pure lines (varieties, strains) that differ in two observed traits. In Mendelian sense, between the alleles of both these loci there is a relationship of complete dominance - recessive. For example: RRYY/rryy parents result in F1 offspring that are heterozygous for both R and Y (RrYy).
The rules of meiosis, as they apply to the dihybrid, are codified in Mendel's first law and Mendel's second law, which are also called the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment, respectively.
For genes on separate chromosomes, each allele pair shows independent segregation. If the first filial generation (F1 generation) produces four identical offspring, the second filial generation, which occurs by crossing the members of the first filial generation, shows a phenotypic (appearance) ratio of 9:3:3:1, where:
the 9 represents the proportion of individuals displaying both dominant traits
the first 3 represents the individuals displaying the first dominant trait and the second recessive trait
the second 3 represents those displaying the first recessive trait and second dominant trait
the 1 represents the homozygote, displaying both recessive traits.
