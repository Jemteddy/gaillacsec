The Missing Piece is an album by British progressive rock band Gentle Giant which was released in 1977. After the Interview tour this return to the studio marked a change of direction for the band with the first side of the album exploring different musical directions than the band was previously known for, including pop music and punk rock, while the second side was more in the vein of Gentle Giant's signature progressive rock style. This was the last Gentle Giant album to chart in the United States.
