Jeffrey J. Carter (born January 1, 1985) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre currently playing for the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL). During his NHL career, he has won the Stanley Cup in 2012 and 2014, has appeared in one All-Star Game in 2009, and led the Philadelphia Flyers – for whom he played six seasons – in scoring during their 2008–09 campaign; his 46 goals during that season were good for second overall in the NHL. Carter also played 39 games with the Columbus Blue Jackets during the 2011–12 season before being traded to Los Angeles.
Carter played junior in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) for four seasons, earning OHL First Team All-Star, William Hanley Trophy and CHL Sportsman of the Year honours in his final year. Joining the Flyers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Philadelphia Phantoms, immediately after his junior career, he helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2005.
Internationally, Carter has won gold medals with Team Canada at the under-18, under-20 levels and at the Olympics. During his under-20 career, he tied as Canada's all-time leading scorer at the World Juniors and was named to back-to-back Tournament All-Star Teams. He has also represented Canada at the 2006 IIHF World Championship. Carter represented Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, where he won a gold medal.


== Playing career ==


=== Early career ===
Carter played minor hockey in London, Ontario, with the London Jr. Knights rep program. He then played bantam hockey with the AAA Elgin-Middlesex Chiefs of the Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA) before spending a season with the Strathroy Rockets, a Junior B team.
Carter was selected in the first round, 3rd overall, of the 2001 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection by the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. He began his OHL career in 2001–02, recording 35 points over 63 games as a rookie. The following season, he improved to 71 points. In the off-season, the Philadelphia Flyers selected him 11th overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft.
Returning to the Greyhounds following his draft, he earned Second Team OHL All-Star honours in 2003–04 with a 66-point campaign. Following his third OHL season, he was assigned by the Flyers to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Philadelphia Phantoms, for their 2005 Calder Cup playoff season. He recorded five points over 12 games in his initial stint at the professional level. Back in the OHL for his final junior season in 2004–05, he recorded a major junior career-high 74 points (34 goals and 40 assists) in 55 games. He was a First Team OHL All-Star that season and won the OHL and CHL Sportsman of the Year Awards. After the Greyhounds were eliminated from the 2005 OHL playoffs, Carter joined the Phantoms once more and recorded 23 points (12 goals and 11 assists) in 21 playoff games, helping the team win the Calder Cup.


=== Philadelphia Flyers ===
The next season, in 2005–06, Carter made the Flyers' roster out of training camp. He was joined by fellow rookies Mike Richards and R. J. Umberger, who were both also instrumental in the Phantoms' Calder Cup championship of the previous season. He scored his first career NHL goal on October 27, 2005, against Roberto Luongo of the Florida Panthers. He finished the campaign first in team-scoring among rookies with 23 goals and 42 points.
After 37- and 53-point efforts in his second and third NHL seasons, respectively, Carter and the Flyers agreed to a three-year, $15-million contract extension on June 27, 2008, days before he was set to become a restricted free agent. He responded with a breakout campaign in 2008–09, leading the team in scoring with 46 goals and 84 points. During the season, he was also named to his first NHL All-Star Game, representing the Eastern Conference. Despite a strong regular season, Carter was held to just one goal in six Stanley Cup playoff games as the Flyers were eliminated by the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games. His series was also marred when he failed to score with an open net in front of him in Game 2 of the series, where Penguins goalie Marc-André Fleury made a toe save to block the shot that would have given the Flyers a 3–1 lead late in the third period. Carter was later called off for a hooking penalty and the Penguins scored to tie the game and eventually win in overtime. It was later revealed that Carter had played the final four games of the series with a separated shoulder.
On November 13, 2010, Carter signed an 11-year, $58 million contract extension with the Flyers through to the 2021–22 season. The deal features a full no-trade clause from 2012 to 2015, followed by a limited no-trade clause thereafter.


=== Columbus Blue Jackets ===

While in the midst of a major re-tooling, the Flyers traded Carter to the Columbus Blue Jackets on June 23, 2011, in exchange for Jakub Voracek, a 2011 first-round pick (Sean Couturier) and a 2011 third-round pick (Nick Cousins).
Despite being injured in the start of the season, Carter was named an alternate captain with the Blue Jackets, one of four rotating alternates along with James Wisniewski, former Flyers teammate R. J. Umberger and Antoine Vermette.


=== Los Angeles Kings ===
On February 23, 2012, Carter was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Jack Johnson and a conditional first-round pick, reuniting him with former Flyer and close friend Mike Richards.
On June 11, 2012, Carter scored the eventual Stanley Cup-winning goal in Game 6 of the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals against the New Jersey Devils. He would finish the 2012 playoffs with eight goals and five assists.
During the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Carter scored 26 goals along with seven assists, playing in all 48 regular season games.
In the first round of the 2014 playoffs, the Kings rallied back from a 3–0 series deficit against the San Jose Sharks to win four-straight and take the series in seven games. This made Carter one of the first and only two players (the other being his teammate Mike Richards) in history to be a part of two teams who achieved such a feat (Philadelphia Flyers in 2010, Los Angeles Kings in 2014; though Carter missed the Flyers' series in 2010 due to injury).
Early in the 2014–15 season, Carter was named the NHL's First Star of the Week for October 20–26 after scoring two goals and four assists in just two games. This helped the reigning Stanley Cup champion Kings maintain a perfect 6–0 record during their season-opening homestand. On February 15, 2015, Carter passed the 500 career NHL point mark with a three-assist performance against the Calgary Flames in a 5–3 victory for the Kings.


== International play ==

Carter debuted internationally with Team Canada with the under-18 team at the 2003 IIHF World U18 Championships. He scored six points in seven games, helping Canada to their first-ever gold medal at the tournament.
The following year, Carter moved on to the Canadian national under-20 team, playing in back-to-back World Junior Championships. Winning silver in 2004 and gold in 2005, he was named to the tournament's All-Star Team in both instances. His combined 12 goals over both years tied him with Eric Lindros (later also tied by John Tavares) for Canada's all-time record at the World Juniors. Lindros had played in three tournaments between 1990 and 1992 (one more than both Carter and Tavares). Carter had been joined on the World Junior squads by two future Philadelphia Flyers teammates, Mike Richards and Braydon Coburn.
Following his rookie NHL season, Carter played for the Canadian men's team at the 2006 World Championships. He recorded six points in nine games as Canada failed to qualify for a medal. He was also selected as a reserve by Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics should an injury occur.
Carter then played for Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics, where he scored a natural hat-trick against Austria, and eventually took home gold after helping defeat Sweden in the final.


== Personal life ==
Carter owns a house in Sea Isle City, New Jersey, which he bought when he was a member of the Philadelphia Flyers. He spends time there during the NHL off-season.
In June 2014, days after winning his second Stanley Cup with the Los Angeles Kings, Carter became engaged to longtime girlfriend Megan Keffer. They married on July 12, 2014.
Carter is good friends with Mike Richards, his teammate from his tenure with the Flyers and the Kings.
