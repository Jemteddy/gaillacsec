An episode is a coherent narrative unit within a larger dramatic work such as a film or television series. An episode is to a sequence as a chapter is to a book. Most are from 20 to 40 minutes in length.
The word derives from the ancient Greek ἐπεισόδιον (epeisodion), meaning the material contained between two songs or odes in a Greek tragedy.
