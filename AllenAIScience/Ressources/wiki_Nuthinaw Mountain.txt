Nuthinaw Mountain is a mountain on the Stikine Plateau in northern British Columbia, Canada, located east of Tutsingale Mountain and 72 km (45 mi) northwest of Dease Lake on the north side of Tachilta Lakes. It is a product of subglacial volcanism during the Pleistocene period when this area was covered by thick glacial ice, forming a subglacial volcano that never broke through the overlying glacial ice known as a subglacial mound.
Nuthinaw is a Tahltan name meaning Cariboo fence went right into mountain.
