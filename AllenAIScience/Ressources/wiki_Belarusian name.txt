A modern Belarusian name of a person consists of three parts: given name, patronymic, and family name, similarly to names in other East Slavic cultures: Russian names and Ukrainian names.


== Belarusian given names ==
As with most cultures, a person has a given name chosen by the parents. First names in East-Slavic languages mostly originate from three sources: Orthodox church tradition (which is itself of Greek origin), Catholic church tradition (which is itself of Latin origin) and native pre-Christian Slavic origin lexicons. Most names have several diminutive forms.


== Belarusian family names (surnames) ==
In Belarus and most of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, surnames first appeared during the late Middle Ages. They initially denoted the differences between various people living in the same town or village and bearing the same name. The conventions were similar to those of English surnames, using occupations, patronymic descent, geographic origins, or personal characteristics.
Belarusian surnames, like those in most of Europe, are hereditary and generally patrilineal, i.e., passed from the father on to his children.
Depending on the region, Belarusian surnames could have a different form and different ending.
One very large group of surnames end with the common Slavonic suffixes -vich (wicz) and -ich (icz) (Dashkevich,Shushkevich, Vaytsiushkevich, Matskevich, Mickewicz) or -ski (feminine form -skaya: Navitski, Kalinouski).
One common suffix in surnames is -chuk (Ramanchuk) or its simplified versions -yuk and -uk.
Other group includes surnames with the suffix -ka (Lukashenka, Yakavenka), -onak, -ionak (Malashonak, Manionak).
A different suffix is -enia (Maysenia, Astapenia)
