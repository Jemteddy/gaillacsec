The vomeronasal cartilage (or Jacobson's cartilage) is a narrow strip of cartilage, low on the medial wall of the nasal cavity. It lies between the cartilaginous nasal septum and the vomer. The cartilage lies below, but is not connected to, the rudimentary vomeronasal organ of Jacobson.
Ludwig Lewin Jacobson (1783â€“1843), a Danish anatomist, named this structure in 1809.
