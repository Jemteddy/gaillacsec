An anticyclonic storm is a weather storm where winds around the storm flow contrary to the direction dictated by the Coriolis effect about a region of low pressure. In the Northern Hemisphere, anticyclonic storms involve clockwise wind flow; in the Southern Hemisphere, they involve counterclockwise wind flow.
Anticyclonic storms usually form around high-pressure systems. These do not "contradict" the Coriolis effect; it predicts such anticyclonic flow about high-pressure regions. Anticyclonic storms, as high-pressure systems, usually accompany cold weather and are frequently a factor in large snowstorms. Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a well-known extraterrestrial example of an anticyclonic system.
Anticyclonic tornadoes often occur; while tornadoes' vortices are low-pressure regions, this occurs because tornadoes occur on a small enough scale such that the Coriolis effect is negligible.
