This is a list of characters in the Transformers comics series.


== Non-Transformer characters ==


=== A ===
"Aunty" - The Autobots computer on board the Ark.


=== B ===
Walter Barnett - US government official and friend of the Autobots. Originally suspicious of the Autobots, Barnett became convinced they were friendly after seeing they chose not to fight back when attacked by humans. Barnett saved the lives of the Throttlebots by transferring their "brains" to toy cars before their bodies were destroyed.
Berko - Originally a homeless man, abducted into the Cosmic Carnival. Eventually becomes the Cosmic Carnival's ringmaster.
B'ghdad - Crime lord. He appears in a Matrix Quest story based on the film The Maltese Falcon.
Big Top - Owner of the Cosmic Carnival.
G. B. Blackrock - Millionaire and friend of the Autobots. Blackrock owns several companies, most prominently a chain of gas stations. He is a bit of a playboy and likes to flaunt his riches. Following an attack by the current Decepticon commander, Shockwave, at one of his seabound oil refineries, one of Blackrock's workers, Josie Beller, was crippled. Feeling responsible for her neurological injuries, Blackrock swore revenge on the Transformers by developing an anti-robot weapon. Later, though, Blackrock joins the Autobots. In the latter part of the series, Blackrock founded a team of human superheroes called the Neo-Knights. Blackrock himself does not have super powers, he simply acts as the team's manager. In the ReGeneration One comics by IDW Publishing, two decades of constant war against the Decepticons has forced Blackrock to abandon his millionaire playboy lifestyle and become a survivalist warrior, joining Spike Witwicky's resistance group against the Decepticons. The war has crippled Blackrock, leaving him bound to a mobile chair device, similar to the wheelchair-bound Professor Charles Xavier. Blackrock also has a Shattered Glass counterpart by the name of R.J. Blackrock.


=== C ===
Carissa Carr - Science fiction film actress. Carr played the lead female character in a movie, where the Decepticon Pretender Skullgrin was chosen as the main villain. This led to an enormously successful movie career for Skullgrin, but it ended abruptly when Circuit Breaker discovered he was a robot and attacked him.
Charlene - Woman who accidentally became Skids's friend.


=== D ===
Jake Dalrymple - Short-tempered man.
Death's Head - A robotic bounty hunter (or rather, as he calls himself, a "freelance peace-keeping agent").


=== F ===
Miss Fatale - Resourceful female adventurer. She appears in a Matrix Quest story based on the film The Maltese Falcon.
Charlie Fong - Scientist. Fong helped the Autobots Goldbug and Blaster survive an infection of Scraplets.


=== G ===
Galen Kord - A Nebulan who preceded Spike Witwicky as the biological binary-bonded partner of Fortress Maximus. Like the other Nebulan partners of the Headmasters, Galen was binary-bonded to Fortress Maximus already on Nebulos, before the Nebulan council drove all the Transformers and their Nebulan partners off their homeworld. Galen had a romantic interest with Llyra, Lord Zarak's daughter, but was forced to abandon it after both he and Zarak (binary-bonded to Scorponok) were driven off Nebulos. Galen was killed by Scorponok inside a mountain cave on Earth, inviting Spike Witwicky to succeed him. Unlike all other Nebulan partners appearing in the comics, Galen was never produced as a toy.
Gutt - Crime lord. He appears in a Matrix Quest story based on the film The Maltese Falcon.


=== H ===
Hook, Line and Sinker - Assassins created by Unicron. They originally were three minor criminals from the planet Ghennix. As Unicron devoured the planet, he reformatted the criminals into three powerful assassins to serve as Galvatron's assistants. However, Galvatron betrayed his master and killed Hook, Line and Sinker.


=== J ===
Jake "Jackhammer" Jackson - Professional wrestler. He participated in a couple of wrestling matches against the Autobot Micromaster Roadhandler. His nickname comes from his use of a real jackhammer in the ring.
J'Oh - Bartender. He serves as the bartender of the Central Space Station and is decidedly unfriendly to robots, whom he refuses to serve anything.


=== L ===
Llyra - Lord Zarak's daughter. In love with Galen Kord, Llyra was torn between two devotions. Llyra was left heartbroken on Nebulos as both her father and her lover were forced to depart, having affiliated themselves with opposing sides.


=== M ===
Mecannibals - A race of robots that eat other robots. These bright red, spherical robots live on a spaceship in orbit around the Central Space Station. The Autobot Sky Lynx was captured by them and about to be eaten, but he was rescued by the Pretenders Cloudburst and Landmine.
The Mechanic - Notorious car thief. The Mechanic's criminal career underwent a huge improvement after he accidentally stole the Autobot Ratchet, who he thought was just a normal ambulance. This gave the Mechanic access to the Ark's technology, which he used to fit various weapons into stolen cars. His criminal career was finally put to an end by a co-operation with the Autobot Blaster and the local police.


=== N ===
Neo-Knights - Team of four superheroes.
Circuit Breaker (Josie Beller). Invented a kind of bodysuit with imbedded circuits that allowed her to move her body after a spinal cord injury, disrupt the circuits of electronic devices and Transformers, and fly.
Dynamo (Hector Dialonzo). Can channel the force of the Earth itself and use it to his advantage.
Rapture (Katrina Vesotzky). Can project images into a person's or other animal's or even a robot's mind, causing him/her to dream and forget the real situation.
Thunderpunch (Lee Gruber). Has tremendous strength.


=== O ===
"O" - Buster Witwicky's friend. "O", whose real name has not been mentioned, only appeared in the very early issues. He usually likes to hang out with Buster and his girlfriend Jessie.


=== R ===
Roadjammers - Group of four vigilantes.
Robot-Master - Comic book figure and actor.
Rorza - Stunt driver. A very minor character, Rorza's only appearance was as a stunt driver in the Cosmic Carnival, where he tried to stop Sky Lynx and Berko from escaping.


=== S ===
Cecilia Santiago - Talk show host. A fairly minor character, she presented a talk show where the Autobot Micromaster Roadhandler appeared as a guest during his career as a professional wrestler.
Scraplets - Robotic parasites. Scraplets are semi-sentient robotic lifeforms, about five centimetres tall. Like the Transformers, they can transform between two modes: from various humanoid or animal modes to nuts or bolts. Scraplets feed on other robotic lifeforms, fastening themselves in the host robot's armour plating using some kind of corrosive agent. Using the raw materials of the host, a Scraplet can multiply itself, creating more Scraplets. The Scraplets' only weakness is water. When doused with water, a Scraplet loosens its grip on the host, allowing it to be safely destroyed without harming the host. In Transformers Prime, Scraplets are considered to be Cybertron's most dangerous form of vermin and resemble small orbs similar in size to a soccer ball with eight pairs of legs, a mill of razor-sharp teeth, and the ability to fly in pursuit of prey. As mentioned by Bulkhead and Ratchet, they travel in large swarms and can dismantle large transformers in minutes as was seen in "Orion Pax: Part 3" when they were used b Jack Darby to kill an Insecticon. Inlike their G1 counterparts, Scraplets in Transformers prime cannot transform and have a severe weakness to extreme cold, being easily dispatched by Jack Darby's fire extinguisher and the subzero temperatures of the Arctic where they were lured to by Bulkhead in "Scrapheap".
Soriza - Nebulan council member.


=== W ===
Witwicky family - The oldest friends of the Autobots.
Spike Witwicky - Buster's younger brother and husband of Carly Witwicky.
Sparkplug Witwicky - Father of Spike and Buster. Grandfather of Daniel.
Buster Witwicky - The first Witwicky introduced.
Daniel Witwicky (cameo) - Son of Spike, like his animated counterpart, though he was once portrayed as Buster's son.
Jessie Witwicky - Buster's girl friend. In one story, she married Buster and had a son named Daniel.


=== Z ===
Ethan Zachary - Computer programmer. The owner and chief software architect of a computer games company. It was in his company that Optimus Prime and Megatron fought in a virtual battle, ending with the apparent death of Optimus Prime. However, Zachary had saved Optimus Prime's mind on a floppy disk, and he was later resurrected as a Powermaster.
