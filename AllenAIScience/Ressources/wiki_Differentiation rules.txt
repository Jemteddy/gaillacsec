This is a summary of differentiation rules, that is, rules for computing the derivative of a function in calculus.


== Elementary rules of differentiationEdit ==
Unless otherwise stated, all functions are functions of real numbers (R) that return real values; although more generally, the formulae below apply wherever they are well defined—including complex numbers (C).


=== Differentiation is linearEdit ===

For any functions f and g and any real numbers a and b the derivative of the function h(x) = af(x) + bg(x) with respect to x is

In Leibniz's notation this is written as:

Special cases include:
The constant factor rule

The sum rule

The subtraction rule


=== The product ruleEdit ===

For the functions f and g, the derivative of the function h(x) = f(x) g(x) with respect to x is

In Leibniz's notation this is written


=== The chain ruleEdit ===

The derivative of the function of a function h(x) = f(g(x)) with respect to x is

In Leibniz's notation this is written as:

However, by relaxing the interpretation of h as a function, this is often simply written


=== The inverse function ruleEdit ===

If the function f has an inverse function g, meaning that g(f(x)) = x and f(g(y)) = y, then

In Leibniz notation, this is written as


== Power laws, polynomials, quotients, and reciprocalsEdit ==


=== The polynomial or elementary power ruleEdit ===

If , for any number  then

Special cases include:
Constant rule: if  then f is the constant function f(x) = c, for some number c, and, for all x, f′(x) = 0.
if f(x) = x, then f′(x) = 1. This special case may be generalized to:
The derivative of an affine function is constant: if f(x) = ax + b, then f′(x) = a.

Combining this rule with the linearity of the derivative and the addition rule permits the computation of the derivative of any polynomial.


=== The reciprocal ruleEdit ===

The derivative of h(x) = 1/f(x) for any (nonvanishing) function f is:

In Leibniz's notation, this is written

The reciprocal rule can be derived from the chain rule and the power rule.


=== The quotient ruleEdit ===

If f and g are functions, then:
 wherever g is nonzero.
This can be derived from reciprocal rule and the product rule. Conversely (using the constant rule) the reciprocal rule may be derived from the special case f(x) = 1.


=== Generalized power ruleEdit ===

The elementary power rule generalizes considerably. The most general power rule is the functional power rule: for any functions f and g,

wherever both sides are well defined.
Special cases:
If f(x) = xa, f′(x) = axa − 1 when a is any real number and x is positive.
The reciprocal rule may be derived as the special case where g(x) = −1.


== Derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functionsEdit ==

note that the equation above is true for all c, but the derivative for c < 0 yields a complex number.

the equation above is also true for all c but yields a complex number if c<0.


=== Logarithmic derivativesEdit ===
The logarithmic derivative is another way of stating the rule for differentiating the logarithm of a function (using the chain rule):
 wherever f is positive.


== Derivatives of trigonometric functionsEdit ==

It is common to additionally define an inverse tangent function with two arguments, . Its value lies in the range  and reflects the quadrant of the point . For the first and fourth quadrant (i.e. ) one has . Its partial derivatives are


== Derivatives of hyperbolic functionsEdit ==


== Derivatives of special functionsEdit ==


== Derivatives of integralsEdit ==

Suppose that it is required to differentiate with respect to x the function

where the functions  and  are both continuous in both  and  in some region of the  plane, including  , and the functions  and  are both continuous and both have continuous derivatives for . Then for :

This formula is the general form of the Leibniz integral rule and can be derived using the fundamental theorem of calculus.


== Derivatives to nth orderEdit ==
Some rules exist for computing the nth derivative of functions, where n is a positive integer. These include:


=== Faà di Bruno's formulaEdit ===

If f and g are n times differentiable, then

where  and the set  consists of all non-negative integer solutions of the Diophantine equation .


=== General Leibniz ruleEdit ===

If f and g are n times differentiable, then
