Vast Oceans Lachrymose is the third full-length studio album by While Heaven Wept, and their first to feature lead vocalist Rain Irving. Released in November 2009 by Italian label Cruz Del Sur, most of the material was ready in 2005 but was delayed by line up changes and label trouble. Previous record label Rage of Achilles Records went out of business and Black Lotus Records (their next label) filed for bankruptcy. The album cover features artwork by the late John Martin.
