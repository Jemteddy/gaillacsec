Lichtenstein's hartebeest (Alcelaphus lichtensteinii) is a savannah- and floodplain-dwelling antelope found in southern Central Africa. By some, this species is classified as Sigmoceros lichtensteinii.
Lichtenstein's hartebeest typically stand about 1.25 m (4 ft) at the shoulder and have a mass of around 150 kg (330 lb). Lichtenstein's hartebeest are a red brown colour, which is lighter on the underbelly. The horns found on both sexes appear from the side to be shaped like the letter 'S', and appear from the front to be shaped like the letter 'O' with its upper portions missing. The horns are slightly ridged and reach over 0.5 m in length.
Lichtenstein's hartebeest live on savannas and floodplains where they eat grasses. They are diurnal (active in the day). They gather in herds of five to 15 females and calves with a single male, which leads them. The male stands sentry duty on termite mounds and the like. Males hold large territories, which they mark by digging up soil with their horns around the borders. Lichtenstein's hartebeest have good eyesight but a poor sense of smell. Their main sounds are a bellow and a sneeze-snort sound.
It derives its name from zoologist Martin Lichtenstein.
