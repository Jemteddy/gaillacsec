== Playing style ==
Bojan Krivec is a very diverse player. He is both very dynamic and patient when needed. He is known to explode on the court sometimes. For example, in a league match against Maribor, he once scored 9 points in a row in various ways - scoring twice by driving all the way to the basket then making a three pointer and to seal it all of handling two free throws.
On the other hand, one of his most recognised play organising moves has much to do with control and calmness. He is a contemplative player, he doesnâ€™t rush it. Pressure excites him so he likes to take his time to prepare the ground for a well executed play. He likes to wait and do nothing at the top of the keep for most of the attack in order to create the best opportunity for his players to score.
