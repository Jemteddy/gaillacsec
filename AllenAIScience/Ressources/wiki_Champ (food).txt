Champ (brúitín in Irish) is an Irish dish, made by combining mashed potatoes and chopped scallions with butter and milk, and optionally, salt and pepper. It is simple and inexpensive to produce. In some areas the dish is also called "poundies".
Champ is similar to another Irish dish, colcannon, which uses kale or cabbage in place of scallions.
The word champ has also been adopted into the popular Hiberno-English phrases, to be "as thick as champ", meaning to be stupid, and to be "as ignorant as champ at a wedding", meaning to be uncultured or boorish (champ being a common everyday dish, not one befitting a banquet celebration).
