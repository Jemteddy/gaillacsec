A gene map is the descriptive representation of the structure of a single gene. It includes the DNA sequence of a gene with introns and exons, 3' or 5' transcribed-untranslated regions, termination (poly-adenylation) signal, regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers and it may include known mutations defining alternative alleles of the same gene.

Genetic linkage: the pattern of genetic linkage for a chromosome or other stretch of genes can be represent as a "linkage map" (also called a "genetic map"), and the generation of such linkage maps is known as "mapping genes".
