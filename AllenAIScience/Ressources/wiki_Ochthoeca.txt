Ochthoeca is a genus of birds in the Tyrannidae family.
In recent times, it has usually contained the following species:
Brown-backed chat-tyrant, Ochthoeca fumicolor
White-browed chat-tyrant, Ochthoeca leucophrys
Piura chat-tyrant, Ochthoeca piurae
D'Orbigny's chat-tyrant, Ochthoeca oenanthoides
Rufous-breasted chat-tyrant, Ochthoeca rufipectoralis
Slaty-backed chat-tyrant, Ochthoeca cinnamomeiventris
Maroon-belted chat-tyrant, Ochthoeca cinnamomeiventris thoracica

Crowned chat-tyrant, Ochthoeca frontalis
Kalinowski's chat-tyrant, Ochthoeca frontalis spodionota

Jelski's chat-tyrant Ochthoeca jelskii
Yellow-bellied chat-tyrant Ochthoeca diadema
Golden-browed chat-tyrant Ochthoeca pulchella
But it has turned out that the last three, which some had considered to belong in Silvicultrix, may form a distinct genus. However, they are anatomically very similar and the genetic data may to be inconsistent, so the question is not fully resolved.
