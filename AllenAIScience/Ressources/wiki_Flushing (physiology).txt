For a person to flush is to become markedly red in the face and often other areas of the skin, from various physiological conditions. Flushing is generally distinguished, despite a close physiological relation between them, from blushing, which is milder, generally restricted to the face, cheeks or ears, and generally assumed to reflect emotional stress, such as embarrassment, anger, or romantic stimulation. Flushing is also a cardinal symptom of carcinoid syndrome—the syndrome that results from hormones (often serotonin or histamine) being secreted into systemic circulation.


== CausesEdit ==
fever
alcohol flush reaction
an abrupt cessation of physical exertion (resulting in heart output in excess of current muscular need for blood flow)
emotions: anger, embarrassment (for this reason it is also called erythema pudoris, from the Latinized Greek word for "redness" and the Latin "of embarrassment")
sexual arousal, especially orgasm, (see section to follow)
inflammation (for example, caused by allergic reaction or infection)
high doses of non flush free niacin (vitamin B3)
caffeine consumption
coughing, particularly severe coughing fits
sneezing
cluster headache attack or headache
severe pain
hot flush
hyperthyroidism
Cushing's Syndrome
Sexual intercourse (see below)
some recreational drugs, such as alcohol, heroin, cocaine and amphetamines
carcinoid tumor
Medullary thyroid cancer
pheochromocytoma
mastocytosis
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially emphysema (also known as "pink puffer")
mixing an antibiotic with alcohol
rosacea
tachycardia
hyperglycaemia
histamines
spicy foods
Powerful vasodilators, such as dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
herxheimer reaction (caused by antibiotics)
iron poisoning
atropine poisoning
keratosis pilaris rubra faceii
carbon monoxide poisoning
antiestrogens such as Tamoxifen
hyperstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, especially the vagus nerve
ACNES Abdominal Cutaneous Nerve Entrapment Syndrome, usually in patients who have had abdominal surgery
compression of the nerve by the sixth thoracic vertebrae
butorphanol reaction with some narcotic analgesics (since butorphanol is also an antagonist)
sunburn (erythema)
polycythemia vera
vinpocetine
body contact with warm or hot water (hot tub, bath, shower)
dehydration
fibromyalgia
homocystinuria (flushing across the cheeks)


=== Sex flushEdit ===
Commonly referred to as the sex flush, vasocongestion (increased blood flow) of the skin can occur during all four phases of the human sexual response cycle. Studies show that the sex flush occurs in approximately 50–75% of females and 25% of males, yet not consistently. The sex flush tends to occur more often under warmer conditions and may not appear at all under cooler temperatures.
During the female sex flush, pinkish spots develop under the breasts, then spread to the breasts, torso, face, hands, soles of the feet, and possibly over the entire body. Vasocongestion is also responsible for the darkening of the clitoris and the walls of the vagina during sexual arousal. During the male sex flush, the coloration of the skin develops less consistently than in the female, but typically starts with the epigastrium (upper abdomen), spreads across the chest, then continues to the neck, face, forehead, back, and sometimes, shoulders and forearms.
The sex flush typically disappears soon after orgasm occurs, but this may take up to two hours or so, and sometimes intense sweating will occur simultaneously.
