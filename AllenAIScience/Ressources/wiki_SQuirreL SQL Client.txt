The SQuirreL SQL Client is a database administration tool. It uses JDBC to allow users to explore and interact with databases via a JDBC driver. It provides an editor that offers code completion and syntax highlighting for standard SQL. It also provides a plugin architecture that allows plugin writers to modify much of the application's behavior to provide database-specific functionality or features that are database-independent. As this desktop application is written entirely in Java with Swing UI components, it should run on any platform that has a JVM.
SQuirreL SQL Client is free as open source software that is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.


== Feature summary ==
Object Tree allows for browsing database objects such as catalogs, schemas, tables, triggers, views, sequences, procedures, UDTs, etc.
The SQL Editor, based on RSyntaxTextArea by fifesoft.com, provides syntax highlighting. It can open, create, save and execute files containing SQL statements.
SQuirreL supports simultaneous sessions with multiple databases. This allows comparing data and sharing SQL statements between databases.
SQuirreL runs on any platform that has a JVM.
A plugin architecture facilitates database vendor-specific extensions (information or actions not available using standard JDBC - see SQuirreL SQL Client Plugin API for more details)
Translations for the user interface exist in: (Bulgarian, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Czech, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Spanish, Russian).
Graph capabilities can generate charts showing table relationships.
Bookmarks - user-defined code templates. SQuirreL comes with predefined example bookmarks for the most common SQL and DDL statements.


== History ==
