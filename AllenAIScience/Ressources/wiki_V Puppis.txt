V Puppis (V Pup) is a star system in the constellation Puppis. Its apparent magnitude is 4.45. There is a binary star system at the center with a B1 dwarf orbiting a B3 subgiant star. They have an orbital period of 1.45 days and a distance of only 15 solar radii apart. However, the system moves back and forth, indicating that there is a massive object orbiting them. Based on Kepler's Laws and that since the object is not visible, it is probably a black hole.
