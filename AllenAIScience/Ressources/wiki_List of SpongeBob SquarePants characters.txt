The characters in SpongeBob SquarePants were created by artist, animator and former marine biologist Stephen Hillenburg. In addition to the series' main cast, various celebrities have voiced roles in SpongeBob SquarePants. Notably, Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway voice the roles of recurring characters Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy respectively (Adam West assumed the role of Mermaid Man shortly after Ernest Borgnine's death in 2012), while others have taken a cameo part.


== Creation and conceptionEdit ==
Stephen Hillenburg conceived the characters for SpongeBob SquarePants in 1984, while he was teaching and studying marine biology at what is now the Orange County Ocean Institute. During this period, Hillenburg became fascinated with animation, and wrote a comic book entitled The Intertidal Zone starring various anthropomorphic forms of sea lives, many of which would evolve into SpongeBob SquarePants characters, including "Bob the Sponge", who was the co-host of the comic and resembled an actual sea sponge as opposed to SpongeBob. In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue his dream of becoming an animator.


== Main charactersEdit ==
SpongeBob SquarePants (voiced by Tom Kenny) is the series' title character and protagonist. He is a yellow anthropomorphic sea sponge who physically resembles an artificial, rectangular, kitchen-type cleaning sponge clad in brown short-pants, a white shirt and a red tie. He lives in a pineapple house and is employed as a fry cook at a fast food restaurant called the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob's hobbies include practicing karate with Sandy, as well as jellyfishing, blowing bubbles, playing games with his best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star, and unintentionally irritating his other neighbor, Squidward Tentacles. He attends Mrs. Puff's Boating School but has never passed; his lack of a driver's license is a running gag throughout the series. Green and purple were early color choices for the character before yellow was chosen. He is usually seen as weak and fragile, and his first appearance was in "Help Wanted".
Patrick Star (voiced by Bill Fagerbakke) is a starfish who lives under a rock, and whose most prominent character trait is his low intelligence. He is best friends with SpongeBob and often encourages activities that get the two into trouble, especially when Squidward Tentacles is involved. While typically unemployed throughout the course of the series, Patrick holds various short-term jobs as the storyline of each episode requires. He is good-natured, kind, and is "the tough one" of the two who is often called to fight SpongeBob's battles for him (although he usually gets distracted). Patrick is shown to have a mean temper in certain episodes. His first appearance was in "Help Wanted".
Squidward Tentacles (voiced by Rodger Bumpass) is a octopus with a large nose. He is SpongeBob and Patrick's ill-tempered neighbor with a snobby attitude and a sarcastic sense of humor. He has no talent, although he believes he is extremely talented. He plays the clarinet and loves to paint self-portraits in different artistic styles, which he hangs up around the walls of his house shaped like a moai. He dislikes SpongeBob and his friends as well as his current occupation at the Krusty Krab. He regularly acts condescendingly toward customers.
Sandy Cheeks (voiced by Carolyn Lawrence) is a squirrel from Texas. She has a number of athletic interests, such as "sand-boarding" and karate, and is a rodeo champion. She also works as a scientist, explorer, and inventor. Being from the surface, she lives in a tree which is inside a glass dome so she can breathe. To survive underwater, she wears a diving suit and helmet to travel outside of her tree-dome. Whenever any aquatic creatures enter her air-filled dome, they must wear helmets filled with water to breathe.
Mr. Krabs (voiced by Clancy Brown), is a red crab who owns and operates the Krusty Krab restaurant where SpongeBob works. He is self-content, intelligent, and obsessed with the value and essence of money. He lives in an anchor with his daughter Pearl, who is a whale. The Krusty Krab was originally a retirement home called "The Rusty Krab" which he bought after returning from fighting in the war; when it went bankrupt, he turned it into a restaurant and renamed it "The Krusty Krab." He takes pride in money, his invention of the Krabby Patty, and his superiority over his rival Plankton's restaurant, The Chum Bucket.
Gary (voiced by Tom Kenny) is SpongeBob's pet sea snail. Within the series, snails are analogous to cats, so Gary almost always vocalizes like a cat. Despite this, other characters can understand and communicate with him. Depicted as a level-headed character, Gary sometimes serves as a voice of reason for SpongeBob, and solves problems that his owner cannot.
Plankton (voiced by Mr. Lawrence) is a copepod who owns the Chum Bucket, the rival restaurant to the Krusty Krab. As the villain self-proclaimed archenemy to Mr. Krabs, he constantly tries to steal Krabs' secret recipe for Krabby Patties, but is always unsuccessful (except, temporarily, in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie). Sometimes, not only does he wish to run Mr. Krabs out of business, but he also wishes to rule the world. His wife is Karen, a computer of his creation. Though he is considered the main antagonist of the series, he has been portrayed as a protagonist or antihero on several occasions.


== Recurring charactersEdit ==
Karen (voiced by Jill Talley) is Plankton's nagging computer "WIFE" (as in an acronym for "Wired Integrated Female Electroencephalograph") and voice of reason. She apparently has a mind of her own to the point of making fun of Plankton. Karen usually helps Plankton in his schemes to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula, although on occasions Plankton rejects her ideas and then takes them as if they were his own. She has a sarcastic attitude towards Plankton, and it is revealed in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie that she never agreed to marry Plankton.
Mrs. Puff (voiced by Mary Jo Catlett), is a pufferfish with blonde hair, who is the owner and teacher of a boating school (analogous to driving school, as the "boats" are underwater equivalents to cars). Her first appearance with in the episode "Boating School", which first aired on August 7, 1999. She dreads instructing SpongeBob due to his inability to drive without crashing. As a running gag, she frequently gets in trouble with the police due to SpongeBob's inability to drive without causing public damage.
Pearl Krabs (voiced by Lori Alan) is Mr. Krabs' teenage sperm whale daughter. The series has yet to explain their disparity in species, although in the book SpongeBob's Trivia Book, Mr. Krabs explains that Pearl takes after her mother, suggesting that her mother is a whale. Her mother is never seen or mentioned in the series. Pearl is frequently embarrassed by her father's cheap attitude and often forces him to try and change his habits.
Mermaid Man (voiced by Ernest Borgnine/Joe Whyte/Tom Kenny/Adam West/Joe Alaskey) and his sidekick Barnacle Boy (voiced by Tim Conway/Burt Ward) are two elderly and partially senile superheroes who live in a retirement home and are stars of SpongeBob and Patrick's favorite television show. Mermaid Man is known for completely forgetting things, yelling a prolonged "EVIL!" whenever he hears the word, and Barnacle Boy seems to be the smarter, more sensible of the two. It was revealed in the episode entitled "Mermaid Man Begins" of the 8th season that Mermaid Man's given name is Ernie. Since Borgnine's death (besides their appearance in "Patrick-Man!"), neither Mermaid Man nor Barnacle Boy has appeared, and are rumored to have been discontinued from the show. Aquaman artist, Ramona Fradon, drew the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy comic book adventures.
Larry the Lobster (voiced by Mr. Lawrence) is a lobster lifeguard of the Goo Lagoon. Larry is a bodybuilder and workout fanatic, and has occasionally been seen hanging out with Spongebob and Patrick
The Flying Dutchman (voiced by Brian Doyle-Murray) is an irascible pirate ghost named after a ghost ship, The Flying Dutchman. His first appearance is in the Halloween-themed "Scaredy Pants", though he is first mentioned in "Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost", in which SpongeBob and Patrick discover that he haunts the seven seas because his unburied corpse was used as a window display. Included in his arsenal of supernatural powers are intangibility, levitation, teleportation, energy projection, shapeshifting, interdimensional travel, matter transmutation, and wish-granting. He lives underwater in a giant ship and collects souls, though he also resides in a cavern containing the Davy Jones' Locker, a literal locker stuffed with countless smelly socks, which within the series seems to be analogous to Hell; it is the place where one who trades their souls for wishes go, while "Who the Davey" (analogous to "Who the hell") is once used as a curse word.
Patchy (portrayed by Tom Kenny) is a live-action character who is a pirate and the president of the SpongeBob Fan Club. He lives in an unnamed suburb of Encino, California, and is normally present in specials, often in a dual narrative with the animated SpongeBob, although sometimes he merely introduces the episode. He made a special guest star appearance on Big Time Rush in the episode "Big Time Beach Party" with Carlos Pena, Jr. and Logan Henderson.
Potty (voiced by Stephen Hillenburg/portrayed by Paul Tibbitt) is Patchy the Pirate's "annoying" pet green amazon. Potty is a crudely made puppet controlled by very obvious strings. He is obnoxious and often annoys or talks back to Patchy.
Officer Nancy (Sirena Irwin) and Officer John (Dee Bradley Baker/Thomas F. Wilson/Mr. Lawrence) are partners and the two most commonly seen police in Bikini Bottom, appearing most prominently in Season 3. Nancy is a purple female police fish with blonde hair and John is a male police fish, whose colour vaires. Although John still regularly appears on the show, Nancy has been mostly retired from the series.
Dr. Gilligan Scales (voiced by Rodger Bumpass) is a purple Doctor fish Bikini Bottom doctor.
Elaine (voiced by Mr. Lawrence/Tom Kenny) is a live-action announcer and news anchorfish, resembling a cut-out of a bass fish. Elaine appears in numerous episodes, including the intro to the show. His name is revealed to be Elaine in "The Great Patty Caper", though he has been called Johnny in Battle for Bikini Bottom, although this is only in the video game series, making his canonical name Elaine.
Perch Perkins is a Yellow perch and field news reporter. His name was first revealed in "The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie" as he announced the arrival of the Krusty Krab 2.
Harold SquarePants (Tom Kenny) and Margaret SquarePants (née BubbleBottom) (Sirena Irwin) are SpongeBob's parents, who more resemble sea sponges rather than SpongeBob's shape as a kitchen sponge. Harold is brown with glasses and a moustache, while Margaret is dark orange. They seem to live outside of Bikini Bottom, since SpongeBob says "Goodbye Bikini Bottom!" when he almost moves back to his parents' home in "Home Sweet Pineapple".
Squilliam Fancyson (Dee Bradley Baker) is Squidward Tentacles's arrogant and wealthy arch-rival who has been able to succeed in everything Squidward has only dreamed of doing. He and Squidward compete in the series on many occasions and Squidward normally does not win over his rival. Though sometimes mistaken as a relative of Squidward due to their similarities, they were band classmates in high school and are not related. Squilliam owns a ridiculously large, almost castle-like four-stories mansion including an elevator with a built-in bathtub, toilets with gold toilet paper, and an expansive garden on the rooftop.
Mrs. Betsy Krabs (Paul Tibbitt first two appearances/Sirena Irwin subsequent appearances) is Mr. Krabs' overbearing mother who still treats him slightly like a kid and first appeared in "Sailor Mouth". Plankton has a small crush on her in "Enemy in Law".
Man Ray (John Rhys-Davies/Bob Joles) and the Dirty Bubble (Charles Nelson Reilly/Tom Kenny) are villains against Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Man Ray has a man's body with a helmet shaped to look like a stingray's head which hides the fact that he does not have a head, while the Dirty Bubble is a giant bubble with a villainous face. Man Ray retires as supervillain in the episode he is introduced in, "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III", and seems to have taken a benevolent path as seen in "Shuffleboarding", though he sometimes takes the job again, such as in "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy IV". Charles Nelson Reilly originally voiced the Dirty Bubble, but Tom Kenny has portrayed the character since Reilly's death in 2007.
Grandma SquarePants (Marion Ross) is SpongeBob's paternal grandmother. She has six children with her late husband, whose wisdom SpongeBob sometimes cites when he plans something. She is a stereotypical "sugary sweet grandmother", always spoiling SpongeBob whenever he visits her house with cookies, milk, sweater, and bedtime stories, even though SpongeBob, as he puts it, is already an adult.
Old Man Jenkins (Tom Kenny/Doug Lawrence/Dee Bradley Baker) is an elderly fish who used to live in the Rusty Krab rest home before it became the Krusty Krab restaurant. He currently resides at Shady Shoals Retirement Home along with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. His appearance changes in almost every episode he appears. One of his critical appearances is in "The Sponge Who Could Fly" wherein he plays a farmer, a sailor, and finally, a human cannonball. He is friends with Mama Krabs, as revealed in "Sailor Mouth" and "Friend or Foe?"
King Neptune (John O'Hurley/Kevin Michael Richardson/Jeffrey Tambor/Billy West) is a green merman who is the king of the sea. He possesses powerful reality-warping magic, being able to create a stadium for his cooking duel with SpongeBob, and is able to cook hundreds of patties in one go, though he is terrible at cooking. King Neptune resides in a castle located in an alternate dimension with his wife, Amphitrite, and son, Triton. He is arrogant and selfish, not caring about the fish populace at all, and even corrupts Triton, who does care about the populace at first, to become like himself. A different King Neptune is featured in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. In the film, he resides in Bikini Bottom with his daughter, Mindy. He also carries a trident to channel his powers with.
The French Narrator (Tom Kenny) is the one who narrates in certain episodes, usually at the beginning and the end, and also the time cards. He has a thick French accent. He only appeared once in the entire series in the episode "Doing Time", in which SpongeBob hits a scuba diver with a camera, who is heavily implied to be the narrator. In "Can You Spare a Dime?", the narrator is briefly replaced by an American-accented narrator who states that "So much later that the old narrator got tired of waiting and they had to hire a new one."

== ReceptionEdit ==
The characters of SpongeBob SquarePants have been well-received overall. The titular character SpongeBob has become very popular with children and adults. The character's popularity has spread from Nickelodeon's original demographic of two- to eleven-year-olds, to teenagers and adults, including college campuses and celebrities such as Sigourney Weaver and Bruce Willis. The popularity of SpongeBob translated well into sales figures. In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls sold at a rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time. SpongeBob has gained popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom purposefully targeted marketing at women in the country as a method of building the SpongeBob SquarePants brand. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan as the character's design is very different from already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu. However, the characters have also attracted negative reception, including SpongeBob himself, who was listed as number four on AskMen's Top 10: Irritating '90s Cartoon Characters. Nevertheless, SpongeBob SquarePants was ranked ninth on TV Guide's top 50 cartoon characters.
Arthur Brown, author of Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!, has compared Squidward's voice to that of Jack Benny's.


== Appearances in other mediaEdit ==
The characters of SpongeBob SquarePants have been parodied various times in popular culture. In 2007, the Amsterdam-based company Boom Chicago created a SpongeBob parody called "SpongeBob SquarePants in China," in which a stereotypically Chinese Patrick refuses to go to work and advocates freedom of speech, rights of leisure, and income. During the same year, production company Camp Chaos created a SpongeBob parody entitled SpongeBong HempPants which features five of the series' characters parodied in the form of various drugs. The show was seen on VH1 and Comedy Central. The series has received mixed reviews from television critics; Adam Finley of TV Squad believed the series sounded "hilarious on paper", but ultimately did not demonstrate its full potential. SpongeBob and Patrick were also referenced in Phineas and Ferb, when the characters of the Disney show dug a hole and found a sponge and a seastar. SpongeBob and Patrick also have an appearance in the Disney show Good Luck Charlie when Charlie's parents have a pink square and a yellow star puppet and are performing a potty training show on a fake television set. SpongeBob has made some appearances in TV shows such as The Simpsons, Family Guy, Robot Chicken, Mad, South Park, Futurama, and The Cleveland Show. Wooldoor Sockbat from Comedy Central's Drawn Together is a parody of SpongeBob, and he even has a similar theme song.
