As part of the Federal Government of Germany, the Robert Koch Institute (abbreviated RKI) is an organization responsible for disease control and prevention. It is located in Berlin and Wernigerode, and is a part of the Federal Ministry of Health.


== History ==
The Institute was formed by Robert Koch in 1891 as The Royal Prussian Institute for Infectious Diseases. Koch lived until the age of 66, when he died of a heart attack in Baden-Baden, in May 27, 1910. The director from 1917â€“1933 was Fred Neufeld who discovered the pneumococcal types.


== Operations ==
The Institute prepares a report on cancer in Germany every two years. The institute also plays a role in advising the German government on outbreaks, such as the 2009 swine flu outbreak. In 1941 the Institute was directly involved in setting up experiments into typhus vaccines at Buchenwald Concentration Camp which resulted in the deaths of 127 of the 537 camp inmates involved.
