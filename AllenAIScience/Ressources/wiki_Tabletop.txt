TableTop is a web series about games, directed by Jennifer Arnold. It was created by Wil Wheaton and Felicia Day and is hosted by Wheaton. TableTop is published on Felicia Day's YouTube channel, Geek & Sundry. In each episode, following a brief explanation of one or more tabletop games, Wheaton plays the games with guests, usually web or TV personalities.
A wide range of hobby gaming titles have been played, from classic German-style board games and family games to RPGs and card games. It has been described as "…like Celebrity Poker meets Dinner for Five, where interesting people got together for tabletop games." 
As of 2015, TableTop is in its third season. Season three was crowdfunded via Indiegogo in May 2014 and was the most successful digital series campaign on that site until Con Man broke its record in March 2015.

== Funding campaignEdit ==
On April 5, 2014, Wil Wheaton announced the launch of a campaign on Indiegogo to fund the creation of a third season. The target amount was $500,000 to produce 15 episodes, with additional targets of $750,000 to produce a full season of 20 episodes, and $1,000,000 to film a spin-off RPG series. The campaign exceeded its goals, eventually closing with $1,414,159.


== ImpactEdit ==
Evidence presented by a Canadian online game retailer showed that games featured in TableTop received a boost in sales after the episode aired: this was dubbed "The Wheaton Effect". Game publisher Days of Wonder has said that having titles featured on the show had significant boost on sales.
After the game Tsuro was featured, demand was so high, that the publisher exhausted all stock reserves. The game was, for a time, unavailable in Europe as production tried to cope with US demand.
In 2013 the web series won the Diana Jones Award, citing that 'Tabletop has brought a new energy and humour to the board-game field: its blend of good humour and gameplay is pitch-perfect and has introduced a range of titles from modern classics to indie RPGs to thousands of new players.'.
TableTop won the gold ENnie for Best Podcast at the 2013 Gen Con EN World RPG Awards for its Dragon Age episodes. The award was accepted by Chris Pramas on behalf of Wil Wheaton.
