Linear aeration is a relatively new aeration process; it allows water to penetrate the soil and to be retained in the proper amounts. Linear aeration also adds organic nutrition, soil softeners (humus, topsoil, compost, sand, clay, etc.) if necessary.


== Gardens ==
In linear aeration, the necessary organic matter is added on top of the soil surface, between plantings. The grooves are then cut into the soil to let the amendments and additives enter the soil; and recovered in the same passage.


== Lawns ==
Linear aeration also alleviates excessive water in lawn areas. In linear aeration, the necessary organic matter is added on top of the turf. Next, grooves are cut into the turf to let the soil additives enter the soil; the grooves are recovered in the same passage.


== Benefits of linear aeration ==


=== Gardens ===
irrigation water conservation.
promotes stronger and deeper root development, for plant health and drought tolerance.
permits proper distribution of soil amendments and additives.
allows organic nutrition absorption.


==== Lawns ====
alleviates soil compaction in heavily traveled areas
provides smoother lawn surfaces
drastically reduces disruption of actual turf surface compared to coring or plugs aeration
causes minimal interruption of use of athletic fields
