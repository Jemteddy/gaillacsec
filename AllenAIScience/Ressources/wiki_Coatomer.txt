The coatomer is a protein complex that coats membrane-bound transport vesicles. Three types of coatomers are known:
COPI (retrograde transport from trans-Golgi apparatus to cis-Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum)
COPII (anterograde transport from ER to the cis-Golgi)
clathrin and its associated adaptins (endocytosis from the plasma membrane, and trans-Golgi to lysosomes)
