Striated muscle tissue is muscle tissue that has repeating sarcomeres, in contrast with smooth muscle tissue. Specifically, striated muscles are:
Pharyngeal muscle (embryologically different from skeletal muscle)
Cardiac muscle (heart muscle)
Skeletal muscle
Contractions in striated muscles are voluntary, except for the heart muscle, in which contractions are involuntary. Cardiac muscle is often treated separately from the other striated muscles, as it has somewhat different characteristics.
A sarcomere is the functional unit of striated muscles.
