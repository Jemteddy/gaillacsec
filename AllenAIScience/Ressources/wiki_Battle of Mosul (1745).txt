The Battle of Mosul (1745) was a set-piece battle fought between the Persian and Ottoman Empires during the war of 1743-1746. After receiving news of the approach of two Ottoman armies from the west towards his borders, the Shah of Persia, Nader Shah, also divided his forces in two. A contingent was put under the command of Nader's son, Nasrollah Mirza, as he was named after his victory at Karnal, and another was commanded by his person. Nasrollah Mirza set out south west in order to find and destroy the Turkish army.
The Ottoman commander marched into Mosul Eyalet where he was joined by the local Ottoman forces as well as a significant body of Kurdish auxiliaries. However, when the Persian army gave battle it inflicted a crushing defeat. The severity of the Ottoman defeat was such that Nassrollah Mirza wrote to his father, Nader requesting permission to escalate the situation into a full-scale invasion of Ottoman Iraq. The letter reached Nader Shah on the last day of the Battle of Kars (1745) where the Nader had also gained an overwhelming victory.
