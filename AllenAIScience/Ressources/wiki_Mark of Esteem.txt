As a juvenile, Mark of Esteem finished second on his first start before winning a maiden race at Goodwood by three lengths.


=== 1996: three-year-old season ===
His first three-year-old start came in the first Classic of the 1996 season: the 2000 Guineas Stakes at Newmarket. Mark of Esteem won by a short head in a photo finish from Even Top and Bijou d'Inde.
His next start in the St. James's Palace Stakes was a loss to Bijou d'Inde.
Mark of Esteem then won the Group Two Celebration Mile at Goodwood by three and a half lengths and the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot, where he scored by over a length from Classic-winning Henry Cecil filly Bosra Sham. This was the third win of the day for jockey Frankie Dettori at a major meeting when he famously went on to win all seven races. Official handicappers hailed it as the best performance of his generation over a mile for a decade. Mark of Esteem's final start was in America, but he failed to show the same acceleration from mid-division in the Breeders' Cup Mile at Woodbine.
