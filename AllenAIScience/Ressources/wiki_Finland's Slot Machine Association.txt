RAY (short for Raha-automaattiyhdistys, Finland's Slot Machine Association) is a not-for-profit gambling company in Finland. Like Veikkaus, RAY is a gambling monopoly whose proceedings go to domestic charity such as pensioner care and gambling addiction treatment. While RAY is best known for its slot machines, the company also deals in online gambling and controls the only official casino in Finland, Grand Casino Helsinki.
