Galleria at Sunset (informally referred to as Galleria Mall) is the largest and only enclosed indoor shopping mall in Henderson, Nevada and one of the largest malls in the entire state of Nevada. It is located at 1300 West Sunset Road.


== Overview ==
Galleria at Sunset is one of only three enclosed non-outlet malls in the Las Vegas Valley away from the Strip. It is owned and operated by Forest City Enterprises.
The layout is a two-story "Y" shape and includes a total of 1,051,000 ft² of space. The decor is Southwestern and architectural elements, such as indoor fountains, have gained praise; Frommer's describes it as the "most aesthetically pleasing" of the Las Vegas Valley's malls.
The mall has 133 stores and boutiques, including 5 anchors, an indoor car dealership, the community relations office of the Henderson Police Department, and two full-service restaurants.


== History ==
Galleria opened on February 28, 1996. The mall's developer, Forest City Enterprises, announced that it opened the mall with 85% of space leased, which was the highest it had ever achieved in any mall it had developed.
In 2002, the mall opened a 121,000 ft² expansion on the northeast edge that added a new anchor location (now occupied by Dick's Sporting Goods) as well as multiple other stores.
In April 2013, it was announced that Galleria at Sunset would receive its first full-scale renovation since its opening in 1996. The $7-million renovation project includes upgrades to the mall's food court and main spaces, as well as adding extra amenities including free wi-fi throughout the mall. The mall is being rebranded and will be restyled as a sophisticated desert oasis, aiming to attract more upscale merchants and buyers. It has been confirmed that H&M and upscale Boutique Talulah will join the newly renovated mall when the project is complete in Fall 2013.
