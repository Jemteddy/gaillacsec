This page shows large-cell versions of the periodic table. For each element name, symbol, atomic number, and mean atomic mass value for the natural isotopic composition of each element are shown. The periodic table of the chemical elements is a tabular method of displaying the chemical elements.
The two layout forms originate from two graphic forms of presentation of the same periodic table. Historically, when the f-block was identified it was drawn below the existing table, with markings for its in-table location (this page uses dots or asterisks). Also, a common presentation is to put all 15 lanthanide and actinide columns below, while the f-block only has 14 columns. The fifteenth (rightmost) lanthanide and actinide are d-block elements, belonging to group 3, with scandium and yttrium.
Although precursors to this table exist, its invention is generally credited to Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Mendeleev intended the table to illustrate recurring ("periodic") trends in the properties of the elements. The layout of the table has been refined and extended over time, as new elements have been discovered, and new theoretical models have been developed to explain chemical behavior.
