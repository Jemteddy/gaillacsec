Persoonia micranthera, commonly known as the small-flowered snottygobble, is an endangered prostrate shrub with yellow flowers and thin bark. It grows only on two peaks, Bluff Knoll and Isongerup Peak, in the eastern section of the Stirling Range, Western Australia. A slow-growing plant, it takes more than six years to produce flowers and seed.
Prior to 1980, Persoonia micranthera was also present on Coyanerup Peak, but none were found there in 1990, and that population is now believed extinct. In April 1991 an intense bushfire burnt all known populations except for three adult plants on Isongerup Peak. A 1997 survey noted three adults and 150 seedlings on Isongerup Peak, but a 1999 survey of Bluff Knoll found no adults and only two seedlings there.
