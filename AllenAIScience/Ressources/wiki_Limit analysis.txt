Limit analysis is a structural analysis field which is dedicated to the development of efficient methods to directly determine estimates of the collapse load of a given structural model without resorting to iterative or incremental analysis. For this purpose, the field of limit analysis is based on a set of theorems, referred to as limit theorems, which are a set of theorems based on the law of conservation of energy that state properties regarding stresses and strains, lower and upper-bound limits for the collapse load and the exact collapse load.
