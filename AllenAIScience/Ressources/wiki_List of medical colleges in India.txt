The Medical Council of India currently (2014) fully recognizes 381 medical colleges, which will train 50,078 medical students. The Medical Council of India's motto is to provide quality medical care to all Indians through promotion and maintenance of excellence in medical education. Its website maintains an up-to-date list.


== Background information ==
India's medical schools are usually called medical colleges. Medical school quality is controlled by the central regulatory authority, the Medical Council of India, which inspects the institutes from time to time and recognises institutes for specific courses. Most of the medical school were set up by the central and state governments in the 1950s and 60s. But in the 1980s, several private medical institutes were founded in several states, particularly in Karnataka. Andhra Pradesh state allowed the founding of several private institutions in the new millennium. Medical education in a private institute is very expensive.
The basic medical qualification obtained in Indian medical schools is MBBS. The MBBS course is four-and-a-half years, followed by one year of Compulsory Rotating Residential Internship (CRRI). The MBBS course is followed by MS, a post-graduation course in surgical specialities, MS or MD and DNB (Highly qualified P.G. and Super specialization), which are postgraduate courses in medical specialities usually of three years duration, or by diploma postgraduate courses of two years duration. Super or sub-specialities can be pursued and only a MS or MD holder is eligible. A qualification in a super- or sub-speciality is called DM or M.Ch.
In most Indian states, entry to medical education is based on entrance examinations. Some prestigious institutes like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Christian Medical College & Hospital (CMCH) Vellore, Kasturba Medical College (Manipal and Mangalore), Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC), St. John's Medical College (Bangalore) and National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)conduct entrance tests at the national level and attract candidates from all over India.
Though India has many medical schools and produces thousands of medical graduates every year, there is a great shortage of doctors in rural areas. Most graduates do not wish to practice in rural areas due to understaffed hospitals and inadequate facilities.
India is one of only a few countries where graduates from local medical schools end up working in other countries all over the world, but particularly in the Middle East, the UK and the USA.
Indian states with the most medical colleges include Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. States with the fewest include Manipur, Tripura, Chandigarh, Goa, and Sikkim. Following is an incomplete list of medical colleges in India.
