High-density storage for data storage devices like floppy disks, CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, or HDDs refers to the amount of information they manage.
The first storage media, paper media and punched cards, were inefficient, slow, and bulky. These then gave the way to magnetic storage; core memory, drums and, finally, hard drives. For backup, there was removable media; magnetic tape reels and cartridges, floppy disks and removable hard drives. Later optics (CD Rom and DVD drives) supplanted magnetism for archival uses. Today's computers need to store more data than ever and most recent storage replaces moving parts with solid-state electronics.
