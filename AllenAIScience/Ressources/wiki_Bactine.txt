Bactine is an antiseptic, first-aid treatment produced by Bayer. It was developed in 1947 and first used in 1950. It is a topically applied first aid liquid with active ingredients benzalkonium chloride (an antiseptic) and lidocaine (a topical anaesthetic). As an antiseptic, Bactine can help to prevent infections, while the topical anesthetic in Bactine serves to numb the surface of a body part and temporarily relieve pain and itching on the skin.
First mention of the product was in an article in the May 14, 1950 issue of the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade magazine, where an article noted that "Sometime in the next two weeks you may be able to buy what promises to be one of the most useful antiseptics ever put in your medicine chest."
