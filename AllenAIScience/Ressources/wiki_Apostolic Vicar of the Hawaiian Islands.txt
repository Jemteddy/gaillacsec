The Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands was the prelate having ordinary jurisdiction of the Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. The Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands was created by the Holy See in 1847 as the Vicariate Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands. In 1848, the phrase Sandwich Islands was dropped and replaced by Hawaiian Islands. The first Vicar Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands (and the Hawaiian Islands) was Msgr. Louis Desir√© Maigret, SS.CC. The Vicariate derives from the Prefecture Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands, established in 1825 and which was to become in 1833, a part of the larger territory under the ordinary jurisdiction of the Vicar Apostolic of Oriental Oceania entrusted to the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary.
