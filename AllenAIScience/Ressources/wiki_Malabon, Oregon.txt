Malabon (also Clear Lake) is a historical unincorporated community in Lane County, Oregon, United States. The area is now a scattering of rural houses and farms northwest of Eugene, close to Mahlon Sweet Field.
Clear Lake runs through the area. It is a widened stretch of Amazon Creek, a tributary of the Long Tom River.
The soils around Malabon define a series of soil types.
Malabon Elementary School is some 3.5 miles (5.6 km) east-southeast of the historical community.
The Oregon Historical Society has Southern Pacific Railroad timetables listing Malabon.
