A centimetre (international spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures; symbol cm) or centimeter (American spelling) is a unit of length in the metric system, equal to one hundredth of a metre, centi being the SI prefix for a factor of 1⁄100. The centimetre was the base unit of length in the now deprecated centimetre–gram–second (CGS) system of units.
Though for many physical quantities, SI prefixes for factors of 103—like milli- and kilo-—are often preferred by technicians, the centimetre remains a practical unit of length for many everyday measurements. A centimetre is approximately the width of the fingernail of an average adult person.


== Equivalence to other units of lengthEdit ==

One cubic centimetre is equal to 1 millilitre, under the current SI system of units.


== Other usesEdit ==
In addition to its use in the measurement of length, the centimetre is used:
sometimes, to report the level of rainfall as measured by a rain gauge 
in the CGS system, the centimetre is used to measure capacitance, where 1 cm of capacitance = 6988111300000000000♠1.113×10−12 farads
in maps, centimetres are used to make conversions from map scale to real world scale (kilometres)
to represent second moment of areas (cm4)
as the inverse of the kayser, a CGS unit, and thus a non-SI metric unit of wavenumber: 1 kayser = 1 wave per centimetre; or, more generally, (wavenumber in kaysers) = 1/(wavelength in centimetres). The SI unit of wavenumber is the inverse metre, m−1.


== Unicode symbolsEdit ==
For the purposes of compatibility with Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) characters, Unicode has symbols for:
centimetre (㎝) – code 339D
square centimetre (㎠) – code 33A0
cubic centimetre (㎤) – code 33A4
They are mostly used only with East Asian fixed-width CJK fonts, because they are equal in size to one Chinese character.
