Classical Mechanics is a textbook about classical mechanics written by Herbert Goldstein. The scope of the book is undergraduate and graduate level. Since its first publication in 1950, it has been one of the standard references in its subject around the world.
Before the death of Herbert Goldstein in 2005, a new third edition of the book was released, with the collaboration of Charles P. Poole and John L. Safko. In the third edition, the book covers in great detail Newtonian mechanics and its reformulation analytical mechanics, as well as special relativity and some classical electromagnetism in some detail (including the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations), a brief discussion on general relativity, and chapter on chaos theory and fractals. There is an appendix on group theory.
