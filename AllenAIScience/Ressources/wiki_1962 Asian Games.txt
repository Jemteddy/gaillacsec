The 4th Asian Games were held from August 24, 1962 to September 4, 1962 in Jakarta, Indonesia. Most notable is the exclusion of Israel and the Republic of China (Taiwan) from the Games.
Succumbing to pressure from Arab countries and the People's Republic of China, the Indonesian government refused to issue visas for the Israeli and Taiwanese delegations. It had done so against the rules of the Asian Games Federation, and despite its promise to invite all Federation members, including those with whom it had no diplomatic relations (Israel, Republic of China and South Korea).
A total number of 1,460 athletes, coming from 17 countries, competed in this Asiad, where badminton made its debut.

On May 23, 1958, voting for the 1962 venue took place in Tokyo, Japan before the 1958 Asian Games. The Asian Games federation council voted 22-20 in favour of the Indonesian capital over Karachi, the only other candidate.


== Sports ==
Weightlifting was also in the program but IWF withdrew recognition of the Asian Games competition because the Indonesian federation had not been able to guarantee that Taiwan and Israel could take part.


== Participating nations ==
A total of 17 Asian NOCs sent delegations.
