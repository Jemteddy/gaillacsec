In architecture, shoebox style refers to the functionalist style of modern architecture characterised by predominantly rectilinear, orthogonal shapes, with regular horizontal rows of windows or glass walls.

Along the same analogy, it refers to undistinguished styles of apartment houses, such as dingbat apartments.
The puritan and repetitive shoebox style is seen as a way to low-cost construction.
The term "shoebox style" is also applies to concert halls of rectangular shape, as opposed to the traditional circular amphitheatre/arena/horseshoe shapes.
