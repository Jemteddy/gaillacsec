The Paragould Meteorite at 16 inches (410 mm) by 41 inches (1,000 mm) by 24 inches (610 mm) and weighing 370 kilograms (820 lb) is the second largest meteorite ever recovered in North America and the largest stony meteorite chondrite. It fell to Earth at approximately 4:08 a.m. on February 17, 1930.
The fireball could be seen as far away as Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas, and of course, Arkansas. Initially, observers thought it was an airplane crashing.
The meteorite split into many pieces. The largest piece was discovered by W. H. Hodges in an 8-foot (2 m) hole on a farm south of Bethel Church, off Highway 358, a few miles south of Paragould, Arkansas. A smaller piece was found by George W. Hyde in Finch, Arkansas.
It was purchased by Harvey H. Nininger, who later sold it to Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History. It has been on loan to the University of Arkansas since 1988, initially to the University Museum and then after November 2003 to the Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Sciences. It was on display in Mullins Library, at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville till April 11, 2008, when it was moved to the Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Sciences building. Two other pieces were found, one weighing 33 kilograms (73 lb) (presently stored in Washington, D.C.) and another 3.75 kilograms (8.3 lb) piece presently resides in New York.
