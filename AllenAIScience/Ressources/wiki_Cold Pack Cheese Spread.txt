Cold Pack Cheese Spread, also known as Club Cheese or Crock Cheese, is a type of Cheese spread.
Cold Pack Cheese Spread originated in the state of Wisconsin. It was created in a tavern, blending natural cheeses without the use of heat, for snacking. It is often made using Cheddar or Swiss cheeses as a base, using added spices, fruits, vegetables, or nuts as flavoring. Common flavorings include almonds, Port wine, Horseradish, and smoked. However, a wide variety of cheeses may be used in creating this spread.
As with most cheese spreads, Cold Pack Cheese Spread is a soft, spreadable blend of cheeses that can be used in a variety of applications. It can be used as an ingredient in sandwiches, on top of hot foods, such as potatoes, as a base for a cheese sauce, or simply on its own, served with crackers as an appetizer.
