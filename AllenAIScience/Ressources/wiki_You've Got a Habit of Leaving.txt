"You've Got a Habit of Leaving" is a song written by David Bowie in 1965 and released as a single under the name Davy Jones (& The Lower Third). It was the last song that Bowie, born David Jones, released before changing his name to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of The Monkees, and the first of two singles that he recorded with The Lower Third after leaving his previous band, The Manish Boys.
With The Lower Third, Bowie moved away from Americanised R&B of his two earlier singles into Who-style mod music. However, a typical concert at this time could incorporate "Mars" from Gustav Holst's The Planets and "Chim Chim Cheree" from Mary Poppins. Bowie's future manager Ken Pitt attended one of these mid-1960s concerts, where the band finished with The Rodgers and Hammerstein song "You'll Never Walk Alone".
