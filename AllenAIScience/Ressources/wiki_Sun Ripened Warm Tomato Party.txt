The Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party is a joke party that stood candidates in the first Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly elections in 1989. It received 1.17 percent of the vote and its preferences went to elect Residents Rally candidates to the Assembly. Party registration laws that allowed this party and other similar parties (for example the Party! Party! Party! and the Surprise Party) to stand candidates in the Australian Capital Territory have been changed to provide that parties must have 100 members and a constitution before being eligible to register. Usually they are referred to as the SRWT Party.
