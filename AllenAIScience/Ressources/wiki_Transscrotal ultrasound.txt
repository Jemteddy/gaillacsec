Transscrotal ultrasound is an ultrasound scan of the scrotum. It is used in the evaluation of testicular pain, and can help identify solid masses.
Conditions such as Hydrocele testis involve an accumulation of fluid. This fluid may be visible upon direct illumination, but ultrasound may be used to confirm the diagnosis.
