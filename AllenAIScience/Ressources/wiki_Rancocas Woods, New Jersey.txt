Rancocas Woods is an unincorporated community located within Mount Laurel Township in Burlington County, New Jersey, United States. The location that it was developed on used to be the site of an amusement park. Houses in Rancocas Woods were first developed in the 1930s. There were some issues within the community when first developed. No sewers were installed because of limited drainage, which caused floods to occur during heavy rainstorms. The water pressure from fire hydrants was unsubstantial—the volunteer fire department had to pump its water from the nearby Rancocas Creek.
