Alopecia universalis or alopecia areata universalis is a medical condition involving rapid loss of all hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes.


== CausesEdit ==
Alopecia universalis can occur at any age, and is currently believed to be an autoimmune disorder.


== TreatmentEdit ==
There is no standard treatment for alopecia universalis. Many treatments have been explored, including immunomodulatory agents such as imiquimod. Tofacitinib citrate may also have benefits. In June 2014, it was reported that a 25-year-old man with almost no hair on his body grew a full head of hair, and eyebrows, eyelashes, facial, armpit and other hair, following 8 months of treatment.
