Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing services (MEP) is a significant component of the construction supply chain. MEP design is critical for design decision-making, accurate documentation, performance and cost-estimating, construction planning, managing and operating the resulting facility.


== Design and documentationEdit ==
As with other aspect of buildings, MEP drafting, design and documentation were traditionally done manually. Computer-aided design had some advantages over this, in some instances including 3D modeling. Building information modeling provides a computable building model, holistic design and parametric change management of the MEP design.
