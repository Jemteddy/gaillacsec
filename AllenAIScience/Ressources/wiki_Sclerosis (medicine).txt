Atherosclerosis, a deposit of fatty materials, such as cholesterol, in the arteries which causes hardening.
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a disease that attacks the kidney's filtering system (glomeruli) causing serious scarring and thus a cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and adolescents, as well as an important cause of kidney failure in adults.
Hippocampal sclerosis, a brain damage often seen in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy.
Lichen sclerosus, a disease that hardens the connective tissues of the vagina and the penis. An autoimmune disorder.
Liver sclerosis is a common misspelling of cirrhosis of the liver.
Multiple sclerosis, or focal sclerosis, is a central nervous system disease which affects coordination.
Osteosclerosis, a condition where the bone density is significantly increased.

Systemic sclerosis (progressive systemic scleroderma), a rare, chronic disease which affects the skin, and in some cases also blood vessels and internal organs.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis, a hardening of the bile duct by scarring and repeated inflammation.
