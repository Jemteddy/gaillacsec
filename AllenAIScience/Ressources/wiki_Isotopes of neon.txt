Neon (Ne) possesses three stable isotopes, 20Ne, 21Ne, and 22Ne. In addition, 16 radioactive isotopes have been discovered ranging from 16Ne to 34Ne, all short-lived. The longest-lived is 24Ne with a half-life of 3.38 minutes. All others are under a minute, most under a second. The least stable is 16Ne with a half-life of 9×10−21 s. See isotopes of carbon for notes about the measurement.
Standard atomic mass: 20.1797(6) u

=== NotesEdit ===
The isotopic composition refers to that in air.
The precision of the isotope abundances and atomic mass is limited through variations. The given ranges should be applicable to any normal terrestrial material.
Geologically exceptional samples are known in which the isotopic composition lies outside the reported range. The uncertainty in the atomic mass may exceed the stated value for such specimens.
Commercially available materials may have been subjected to an undisclosed or inadvertent isotopic fractionation. Substantial deviations from the given mass and composition can occur.
Values marked # are not purely derived from experimental data, but at least partly from systematic trends. Spins with weak assignment arguments are enclosed in parentheses.
Uncertainties are given in concise form in parentheses after the corresponding last digits. Uncertainty values denote one standard deviation, except isotopic composition and standard atomic mass from IUPAC, which use expanded uncertainties.
