In mathematics, a unitary transformation is a transformation that preserves the inner product: the inner product of two vectors before the transformation is equal to their inner product after the transformation.


== Formal definition ==
More precisely, a unitary transformation is an isomorphism between two Hilbert spaces. In other words, a unitary transformation is a bijective function

where  and  are Hilbert spaces, such that

for all  and  in .


== Properties ==
A unitary transformation is an isometry, as one can see by setting  in this formula.


== Unitary operator ==
In the case when  and  are the same space, a unitary transformation is an automorphism of that Hilbert space, and then it is also called a unitary operator.


== Antiunitary transformation ==
A closely related notion is that of antiunitary transformation, which is a bijective function

between two complex Hilbert spaces such that

for all  and  in , where the horizontal bar represents the complex conjugate.
