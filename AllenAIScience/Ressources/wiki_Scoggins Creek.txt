Scoggins Creek, formerly known as "Scoggin Creek", is a southeast-flowing stream in Tillamook and Washington counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is named for pioneer Gustavus Scoggin. Surrounded by lava and basalt flows and layers of sandstone, it flows down from the Northern Oregon Coast Range and through a 1,700-foot (520 m)-wide valley to Henry Hagg Lake, an impoundment of Scoggins Dam. Just downstream from the lake, the creek empties into the Tualatin River about 20 miles (32 km) west of Portland, at an elevation of 171 feet (52 m).
