Landslide victory is an electoral victory in a political system, when one candidate or party receives an overwhelming majority of the votes or seats in the elected body, thus all but utterly eliminating the opponents. The winning party has reached more voters than usual, and a landslide victory is often seen in hindsight as a turning point in people's views on political matters, as for instance when Ronald Reagan won a landslide election in 1984 in the U.S., or when Tony Blair and his Labour Party won landslides in the UK general elections of 1997 and 2001. In Denmark, the general election in 1973 was dubbed the landslide election (Danish: Jordskredsvalget) because several new parties enjoyed considerable popularity while the older parties suffered severe losses.
Part of the reason for a landslide victory is sometimes a bandwagon effect, as a significant number of people may decide to vote for the party which is in the lead in the pre-election opinion polls, regardless of its politics.
The term is borrowed from geology, where a landslide takes almost everything with it on its way.
