Nightsongs is the first album by Canadian indie rock band Stars, released in 2001 on Le Grand Magistery. At this time, Stars consisted only of Torquil Campbell and Chris Seligman, although both Amy Millan and Emily Haines of Metric make appearances. There is also a very rare vinyl pressing of the record on the Japanese label Syft, which has since gone out of business. The vinyl pressing also has 2 additional tracks ("Friend's Father's Mother" and "Angeline") not featured on the CD version.
