Cartilage structures and functions can relatively easily be harmed, often resulting in damage. Such damage can result from a variety of causes, resulting from a bad fall or sport-accident (traumatic), previous knee injuries (post-traumatic) or wear and tear over time. Immobilization for long periods can also result in cartilage damage.
Articular cartilage damage might be found on its own but it will more often be found in conjunction with injuries to ligaments and menisci. People with previous repairs to ligaments and or menisci often face greater chances of new articular cartilage damage due to altered mechanics in the joint.


== Repairing articular cartilage damage ==
Though articular cartilage damage is not life-threatening, it does strongly affect the quality of life. Articular cartilage damage is often the cause of severe pain, swellings, strong barriers to mobility and severe restrictions to the patient's activities. Over the last decades, however, surgeons and biotech ventures have elaborated promising procedures that contribute to articular cartilage repair.
