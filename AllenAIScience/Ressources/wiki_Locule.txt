A locule (plural locules) or loculus (plural loculi) (the latter meaning "little place" in Latin) is a small cavity or compartment within an organ or part of an organism (animal, plant, or fungus).
In angiosperms (flowering plants), the term locule usually refers to a chamber within an ovary (gynoecium or carpel) of the flower and fruits. Depending on the number of locules in the ovary, fruits can be classified as uni-locular (unilocular), bi-locular, tri-locular or multi-locular. The number of locules present in a gynoecium may be equal to or less than the number of carpels. The locules contain the ovules or seeds.
The term may also refer to chambers within anthers containing pollen.
In the Loculoascomycetes, a group of sac fungi, locules are chambers similar to perithecia, but hollowed out from the host tissue rather than being a preformed structure. For this reason, a single locule is referred to as a pseudothecium. Locules do, however, still contain asci,which hold ascospores, as perithecia do.
