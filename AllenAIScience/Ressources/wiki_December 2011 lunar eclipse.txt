A total lunar eclipse took place on December 10, 2011. It was the second of two total lunar eclipses in 2011, the first having occurred on June 15. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon is positioned just right in its orbit to pass through Earth's shadow.


== Visibility ==
Asia, Australia, and other areas of the Pacific had the best visibility. European countries only saw a partial eclipse of a rising moon, while northwestern North America saw a partial eclipse of a setting moon.
The eclipse was seen over the Philippines despite cloudy and rainy weather over parts of Luzon and other areas. Photos were taken by groups of amateur astronomers from the Astronomical League of the Philippines (ALP).
South America and portions of West Africa missed the eclipse completely as it happened in the early morning.
