The Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine is the graduate medical school of Nova Southeastern University. It is located in Davie, in the U.S. state of Florida.
The College of Osteopathic Medicine is part of the Health Professions Division of the university. The Health Professions Division, with a student body of more than 2,000, is home to Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine, the first College of Osteopathic Medicine in the southeastern U.S., granting the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree. EMS Education and Training, Master of Science in Medical Informatics, and Master of Public Health are also offered.


== History ==
The Southeastern College of Osteopathic Medicine (SECOM) was established in 1979 in North Miami Beach, Florida by Morton Terry, D.O. Following SECOM's success, the College of Pharmacy was added in 1986, followed by the College of Optometry in 1988, creating the Southeastern University of Health Sciences. In 1994, Southeastern University merged with Nova University, creating Nova-Southeastern University. The College of Osteopathic Medicine moved from North Miami Beach, Florida to Davie, Florida, in 1996. A fourth health professions college - the College of Dental medicine - was added in 1997.


== Admissions ==
The matriculants entering the Class of 2017 had an average MCAT of 28 and an overall GPA of 3.49.


== Academics ==
The College of Osteopathic Medicine offers Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.), Master of Public Health (M.P.H.), and Master of Biomedical Informatics (M.S.) degrees. Students enrolled in the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine program can also apply for admission into the combined D.O./M.P.H. program. In addition, and in conjunction with the Nova Southeastern University College of Dental Medicine, the College of Osteopathic Medicine offers a combined D.O./D.M.D. program. Graduates of this six-year program will be qualified for licensure in dentistry and for postgraduate residencies required for medical licensure.


=== Societies ===
First-year medical students are placed into one of 10 societies upon matriculation to the College of Osteopathic Medicine. At the white coat ceremony prior to beginning of the first medical school year, students are officially inducted or "pinned" into their society when they receive their society pin from upperclassmen in their society. Each society is overseen by a faculty member, who serves as an advisor and mentor to students in their society during their medical school years. Each year, students compete in a variety of social and academic events to earn points for their society. At the end of each year, the society with the most overall points receives the College of Osteopathic Medicine Cup, or COM-Cup.
