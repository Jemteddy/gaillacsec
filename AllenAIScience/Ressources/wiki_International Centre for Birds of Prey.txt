== History ==
The ICBP was originally established, as the Falconry Centre, by the Glasier family as a specialised zoo containing only birds of prey, including falcons, hawks, eagles and owls. It had the aim of educating people about birds of prey and their value in the world. It also aimed to teach falconry. It first opened to the public on 25 May 1967.
