Windows Server is a brand name for a group of server operating systems released by Microsoft. It includes all Windows operating systems that have "Windows Server" in their names, but not any other Microsoft product. The first Windows server edition to be released with that brand was Windows Server 2003. However, the first server edition of Windows was Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server, followed by Windows NT 3.5 Server, Windows NT 4.0 Server, and Windows 2000 Server; the latter was the first server edition to feature many things like Active Directory, DNS Server, DHCP Server, Group Policy, and many other popular features used today.
