Chlorophyll f is a type form of chlorophyll that absorbs further in the red (infrared light) than other chlorophylls. It was reported from stromatolites from Western Australia's Shark Bay.
The finding was made by scientists at the University of Sydney led by Professor Min Chen, and is the first discovery of a new form of chlorophyll in 60 years. However, the function of chlorophyll f in photosynthetic reactions is uncertain and the ecological distribution of chlorophyll f remains unknown.
Based on NMR data, optical and mass spectra and density functional theory (DFT) simulation, it is confirmed to have a structure of C55H70O6N4Mg or [2-formyl]-chlorophyll a.
