Circumference (from Latin circumferentia, meaning "carrying around") is the linear distance around the edge of a closed curve or circular object. The circumference of a circle is of special importance in geometry and trigonometry. Informally "circumference" may also refer to the edge itself rather than to the length of the edge. Circumference is a special case of perimeter: the perimeter is the length around any closed figure, but conventionally "perimeter" is typically used in reference to a polygon while "circumference" typically refers to a continuously differentiable curve.


== Circumference of a circle ==

The circumference of a circle is the distance around it. The term is used when measuring physical objects, as well as when considering abstract geometric forms.


=== Relationship with Pi ===
The circumference of a circle relates to one of the most important mathematical constants in all of mathematics. This constant, pi, is represented by the Greek letter π. The numerical value of π is 3.14159 26535 89793 ... (see  A000796). Pi is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference C to its diameter d:

Or, equivalently, as the ratio of the circumference to twice the radius. The above formula can be rearranged to solve for the circumference:

The use of the mathematical constant π is ubiquitous in mathematics, engineering, and science. The constant ratio of circumference to radius  also has many uses in mathematics, engineering, and science. These uses include but are not limited to radians, computer programming, and physical constants. The Greek letter τ (tau) is sometimes used to represent this constant, but is not generally accepted as proper notation.
