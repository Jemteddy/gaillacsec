== Club careerEdit ==


=== Dinamo BucharestEdit ===
Radu began his career with major Romanian club side Dinamo București. Radu played four seasons of first team football with Dinamo, gaining a reputation as one of his country's brightest talents and often considered as "The new Chivu" by Romanian media. However, he only became a key first team-player in the 2006–07 season, when the transfer period left a gap in Dinamo's central defense, a gap which Radu successfully covered, turning over the course of the season from a promising young player into one of the best central defenders in the league, helping Dinamo to win its 18th championship and gaining the attention of several western clubs.


=== LazioEdit ===
In January 2008, Italian Serie A side Lazio came calling, and signed Radu on a loan deal until the end of the season, the loan fee was €1 million. He made his Lazio debut in a Coppa Italia match versus Fiorentina shortly after joining the team on loan. He has since been a revelation for Delio Rossi's team, as the young starlet has added extra quality to the backline and started all matches he featured in. Radu impressed and at was signed permanently in June, for a transfer fee of €3.5 million.
On 17 June 2011 he signed a new five year contract. Radu has become one of the most important players for Lazio, a team which he captained during the 2011–12 season. His role at Lazio is usually that of centre back though he has been used as a left back during the last two seasons under Edoardo Reja.


== International careerEdit ==
Radu made his debut for the Romanian national team in 2006, following the country's failure to qualify for the FIFA World Cup in Germany.
Over the course of Euro 2008 qualifying, Radu gained international experience and was selected in the squad for the final tournament in Switzerland and Austria. At Euro 2008 however, Radu remained a substitute and did not see any game time.
On 25 March 2008 he was decorated by the president of Romania, Traian Băsescu for the results on Qualifying to EURO 2008 and qualification to UEFA Euro 2008 Group C with Medalia "Meritul Sportiv" — (The Medal "The Sportive Merit") class III.
