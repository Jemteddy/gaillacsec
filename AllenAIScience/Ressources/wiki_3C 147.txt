3C 147 (B0538+498) is a compact steep-spectrum (CSS) quasar that was discovered in 1964. It is located in the constellation Auriga not far in the sky from the 5th magnitude star Omicron Aurigae.
The "distance" of a far away galaxy depends on what distance measurement you use. With a redshift of 0.545, light from this active galaxy is estimated to have taken around 5.1 billion years to reach us. But as a result of the expansion of the Universe, the present (co-moving) distance to this galaxy is about 6.4 billion light-years (1974 Mpc).
Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations have identified a complex central region that is dominated by two bright components, A and B. The separation between the two central components of the source seems to be increasing with an apparent velocity (superluminal motion) of 1.2 Â± 0.4 c.
