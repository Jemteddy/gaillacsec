The Chautang river is a seasonal river in the state of Haryana, India. It is a remnant of the Drsadvati,and joins the Ghaggar-Hakra River east of Suratgarh. This river was one of the main contributors to the Sarasvati river until the Yamuna changed its course. However, as per recent studies Yamuna changed its course towards East some 50,000 to 10,000 years ago and Chautang is a rain-fed river and Yamuna is not pouring any water into it from last 10,000 years.
