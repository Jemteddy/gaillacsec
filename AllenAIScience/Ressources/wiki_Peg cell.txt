A peg cell is a non-ciliated epithelial cell within the uterine tube (oviduct or Fallopian tube).
It is also called an "intercalary" cell or "secretory" cell.
It is one of the two epithelial cells of the fallopian tube, along with ciliated simple columnar epithelial cells.


== Function ==
These cells produce a fluid that is rich in nutrients for spermatozoa, oocytes, and zygotes. The cellular secretions also promote the capacitation of spermatozoa by removing glycoproteins and other molecules from their cell membranes.
The cells are outnumbered by ciliated cells in the oviduct, though their number can increase in response to progesterone.
