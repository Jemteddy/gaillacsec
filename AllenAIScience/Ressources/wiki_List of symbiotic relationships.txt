This is a list of mutualistic symbiotic relationships, in which different species have a cooperative or mutually dependent relationship. This relationship can be either external or endosymbiotic, whereby an organism resides in another's body or cells.
Symbiosis can vary between mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism, though these grade into each other, and it is often difficult to tell which is involved in a given relationship. In mutualism, both organisms benefit. In commensalism, one benefits and the other is unaffected; in parasitism, one benefits and the other is harmed.
Some of these relationships are so close that we speak of the composite of two species as one unit; for example, we speak of the composite of algae and fungi as lichens.

== Cleaning symbiosis ==

Many species are involved in cleaning symbiosis, though claimed symbioses grade into commensalism, scavenging and parasitism. A clearly symbiotic example is the cleaner wrasse Labroides, a small fish conspicuously shaped and marked, being longitudinally striped with blue. It eats only ectoparasites at "cleaning stations" from the bodies of larger fish such as puffers, sweetlips and groupers.

Humans and intestinal bacteria
Ruminants such as cows and their intestinal bacteria and protists
Termites and their intestinal bacteria and protists
Aphids and Buchnera bacteria
