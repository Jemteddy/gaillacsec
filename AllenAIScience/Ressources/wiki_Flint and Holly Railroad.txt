The Flint and Holly Railroad (F&H) is a defunct railroad that operated in eastern Michigan from 1863 to 1868. It was founded by Henry H. Crapo, a Massachusetts-born lumber merchant who served as Governor of Michigan (1865â€“1869). The line was originally chartered as the Flint and Fentonville Railroad on January 3, 1863, and was amended on October 16, 1863. On November 1, 1864, the F&H completed a railway line from Flint, Michigan to Holly, Michigan. Via an agreement with the Detroit and Milwaukee Railway (D&M), F&H ran into Detroit's Brush Street Station over D&M tracks.
In 1868 the F&H was bought by the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad (F&PM) and ceased to be an independent company. Henry Crapo's son, William Crapo, served an official of F&PM from 1868 until 1903.
As of 2010 the tracks are part of the CSX Saginaw Subdivision.
