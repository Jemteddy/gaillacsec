"Song for Clay (Disappear Here)" is the opening track from Bloc Party's second album A Weekend in the City and was set to be the fourth single released from the album. The band had even begun work on a music video for the song. It was replaced as the fourth single by a newly recorded song "Flux".
The song is inspired by Bret Easton Ellis' novel Less Than Zero in which the main character's name is Clay. Lyrics in the song include "People are afraid to merge on the freeways" which is a recurring line in the book, and is similar to the opening sentence in the novel. "Disappear Here" is seen on a billboard in the novel, and appears recurrently throughout. Other lyrics, such as "I live the dream" and "When we kiss, I feel nothing" coincide with common topics in the book, which deals with the negative effects of hedonism and promiscuity on the human psyche.
