Bradfield Hall is an academic building located on the central campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. It is located on Tower Road at the eastern edge of the Agricultural Quadrangle.
At 166 feet and 11 stories tall, Bradfield Hall is the tallest building on the Cornell campus and in Tompkins County. Designed in the brutalist style by Ulrich Franzen, the building was completed in 1969. Bradfield currently houses Cornell's departments of Crop and Soil Science, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Plant Breeding, and Genetics. As most of the laboratories in the building are climate controlled, none of the rooms in the first ten stories in Bradfield have windows (the hallways have windows at each end). The eleventh floor contains the Northeast Regional Climate Center, one of the six National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration regional climate centers. Also located in the building are a computer lab and a library. Bradfield Hall was named after Professor Richard Bradfield, a noted crop and soil scientist and Guggenheim Fellowship winner.
Among its accolades, Bradfield Hall has been named one of the "World's 10 most spectacular university buildings" by the building data site Emporis.
