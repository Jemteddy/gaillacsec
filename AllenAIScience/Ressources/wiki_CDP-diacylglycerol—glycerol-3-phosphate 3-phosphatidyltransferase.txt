In enzymology, a CDP-diacylglycerol—glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase (EC 2.7.8.5) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
CDP-diacylglycerol + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate  CMP + 3(3-sn-phosphatidyl)-sn-glycerol 1-phosphate
Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CDP-diacylglycerol and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate, whereas its two products are CMP and 3(3-sn-phosphatidyl)-sn-glycerol 1-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-diacylglycerol:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase. Other names in common use include glycerophosphate phosphatidyltransferase, 3-phosphatidyl-1'-glycerol-3'-phosphate synthase, CDPdiacylglycerol:glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase, cytidine 5'-diphospho-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol, (CDPdiglyceride):sn-glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase, phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase, phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase, PGP synthase, CDPdiacylglycerol-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase, CDPdiacylglycerol:sn-glycero-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase, glycerol phosphate phosphatidyltransferase, glycerol 3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate synthase, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate synthetase, phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthetase, and sn-glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase. This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism.
