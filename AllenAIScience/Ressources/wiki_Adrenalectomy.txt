Adrenalectomy is the surgical removal of one or both (bilateral adrenalectomy) adrenal glands. It is usually advised for patients with tumors of the adrenal glands. The procedure can be performed using an open incision (laparotomy) or laparoscopic technique.


== After surgery ==
If both adrenals are removed, then the subject requires a lifetime of steroid supplementation of cortisone and hydrocortisone. The dose needs to be increased when in stress.
