In enzymology, a mRNA guanylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.50) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
GTP + (5')ppPur-mRNA  diphosphate + G(5')pppPur-mRNA
Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GTP and (5')ppPur-mRNA, whereas its two products are diphosphate and G(5')pppPur-mRNA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase. Other names in common use include mRNA capping enzyme, messenger RNA guanylyltransferase, and Protein 2.


== Structural studies ==
As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes 1CKM, 1CKN, 1CKO, 1P16, and 2C46.
