Fengyun 2-05, also known as Fengyun 2D is a Chinese weather satellite which was launched in 2006. It was the fourth satellite to be launched of the Fengyun 2 series, and the second operational spacecraft. It is part of the Fengyun programme.
A Long March 3A carrier rocket was used to launch Fengyun 2-05, flying from Launch Area 2 at the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre. The launch took place at 00:53 UTC (08:53 CST) on 8 December 2006, with the carrier rocket placing the satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit. An FG-36 apogee motor was then used to raise the satellite into geosynchronous orbit. By 7 February 2007, it was in an orbit with a perigee of 35,787 kilometres (22,237 mi), and apogee of 35,788 kilometres (22,238 mi), and 2.4 degrees inclination. It is positioned at a longitude of 86.5 degrees east.
