Santalum murrayanum, the Bitter Quandong, is an Australian plant in the Sandalwood family, Santalaceae.
It bears a bitter fruit, from which a common name derives, in contrast to congener Santalum acuminatum - sweet quandong. The plant is also known as Ming. It occurs in a hemi-parasitic relationship with the roots of several other plants, in a non-destructive way, as with all the species of the genus Santalum.
