Sulfur water is a condition where the running water contains a high amount of hydrogen sulfide gas that escapes into the air when the plumbing line is opened, giving a distinct "rotten egg" smell.


== Cause and Treatment ==
The condition indicates a high level of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the water supply. This may be due to the use of well water, poorly treated city water, or water heater contamination.
Various methods exist to treat sulfur in water. These methods include
Use of a Carbon Filter (useful for very small amounts of hydrogen sulfide)
Filtering the water through a canister of manganese oxide coated Greensand
Aeration of the water
Treating the water with chlorine (can be used to treat large amounts of hydrogen sulfide)


== Health concerns ==
Studies from The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest that drinking high level sulfate waters can cause diarrhea, particularly for infants.
