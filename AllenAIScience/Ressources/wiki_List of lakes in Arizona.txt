This is a list of lakes and reservoirs located in the U.S. state of Arizona. Many of the lakes listed here contain game fish and are managed by the Arizona Game and Fish Department. Some lakes may dry out or freeze out fish and will require seasonal restocking. Most lakes will not allow large motorboats.
Due to Arizona's dry climate, many of the lakes listed here are intermittent lakes and do not contain water throughout the entire year.
