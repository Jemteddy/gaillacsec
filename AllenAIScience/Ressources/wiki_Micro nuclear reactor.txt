A micro nuclear reactor is a small version of a nuclear reactor (approximately a few tens of meters). It is often so small it can be shipped or flown in.


== Uses ==
Micro nuclear reactors could be used to power large vessels, production facilities (e.g. water purification, or mines), or small (remote) villages.


== Galena ==
The Galena Nuclear Power Plant in Galena, Alaska is a proposed micro nuclear reactor installation intended to reduce the costs and environmental pollution required to power the town. It would use the Toshiba 4S reactor.


== Types ==
Several micro nuclear reactor designs exist. Examples are:
SSTAR
Toshiba 4S
Hyperion
Nereus and HTR-10
Jan Leen Kloostermans' U-battery
RAPID-L
NuScale
B&W mPower (Babcock & Wilcox Company)
ELENA is the smallest commercial nuclear reactor being developed by Kurchatov Institute.
