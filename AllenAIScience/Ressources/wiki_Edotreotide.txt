Edotreotide (USAN, codenamed SMT487, also known as (DOTA0-Phe1-Tyr3)octreotide, or DOTATOC) is a substance which, when bound to various radionuclides, is used in the treatment and diagnosis of certain types of cancer.
It has been the subject of a trial by the National Cancer Institute to determine its effects in young cancer patients (up to 25 years of age) for its ability to locate malignant cancer cells without harming normal cells. Specific cancers being included in the trial include neuroblastoma, childhood brain tumours and gastrointestinal cancer.
