Peeling skin syndrome (also known as "Acral peeling skin syndrome," "Continual peeling skin syndrome," "Familial continual skin peeling," "Idiopathic deciduous skin," and "Keratolysis exfoliativa congenita") is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by lifelong peeling of the stratum corneum, and may be associated with pruritus, short stature, and easily removed anagen hair.
The acral form can be associated with TGM5.
