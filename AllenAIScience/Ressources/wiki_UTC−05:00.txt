UTC−05:00 is a time offset that subtracts five hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). In North America, it is observed in the Eastern Time Zone during standard time, and in the Central Time Zone during the other eight months (see Daylight saving time). The western Caribbean uses it year round.
