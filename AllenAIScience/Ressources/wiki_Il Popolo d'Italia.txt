Il Popolo d'Italia ("The People of Italy"), was an Italian newspaper founded by Benito Mussolini in 1914, after his split from the Italian Socialist Party.
Il Popolo d'Italia ran from November 15, 1914 until July 24, 1943 and became the foundation for the Fascist movement in Italy after World War I. The paper, advocating militarism and irredentism, was subsidized by the French and industrialists on the pretext of influencing Italy to join the Entente Powers. The word “socialist” was displayed on the newspaper’s masthead until 1918 to attract followers to “his idea of a ‘revolutionary war.’” (
This is also where Mussolini spread his ideas about how he wanted Italy to increase its birth rate. From 1936 to 1943 it was edited by Giorgio Pini.
Among the co-founders were Manlio Morgagni, who became an ardent supporter of Fascism and the chairman of news agency Agenzia Stefani.
