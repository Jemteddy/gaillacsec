A propeller speed reduction unit is a gearbox or a belt and pulley device used to reduce the output revolutions per minute (rpm) from the higher input rpm of the powerplant. This allows the use of small displacement internal combustion automotive engines to turn aircraft propellers within an efficient speed range.


== History and operation ==
The Wright brothers recognised the need for propeller reduction gearing in 1903, but it was not generally used on aircraft engines until larger engines were designed in the 1920s. Large engines with high crankshaft speeds and power outputs demanded propeller reduction, pilots noted the increase in performance of similar aircraft fitted with reduction gearing.


=== Types ===

Types of propeller speed reduction units include:
Chain drive
Single reduction or spur gear
Internal spur gear
Farman or bevel planetary type
Fixed sun gear
Fixed internal gear
Belt drive
Epicyclic gearing


=== Design variations ===
The Rolls-Royce Falcon engine of 1915 featured epicyclic propeller reduction gearing which contained a clutch designed to limit the maximum torque, thus protecting the reduction gears. The later Merlin engine from the same company used opposite rotation reduction gears to provide counter-rotating propellers for twin-engined aircraft, a much cheaper method than designing and building the engines to run in opposite directions.
The challenge with coupling gearboxes to internal combustion engines is primarily the torsional resonance that can develop at certain speeds. The load of a propeller and reduction unit can alter the resonant frequencies of the crankshaft, allowing torsional vibration to increase rapidly to high levels at certain rotational speeds. Measures taken by the designer to mitigate torsional resonances in the original design of the engine can be rendered ineffective if the resonant frequency is altered by the use of a reduction unit. Clutches and/or flexible couplings are sometimes used to prevent torsional resonance from reaching damaging levels.
The Continental Tiara series engines were designed to drive their propellers directly from the camshaft (running at half engine speed).


== Applications ==
The use of a reduction unit is common in the construction of experimental homebuilt aircraft when automotive engines may be used. These engines, in addition to their lower cost, are customarily smaller in cubic inch displacement and develop peak torque at high revolutions per minute (rpm), typically near 4,500 rpm. Traditional aircraft engines, where the propeller most commonly is fastened directly to the engine crankshaft, develop peak power near the peak safe and efficient speed for the propellerâ€”2,500 to 3,000 rpm. This speed is considered the typical maximum rpm for a single engine aircraft propeller due to the need to keep the propeller tip speed below the speed of sound.
Factory certified aircraft engines have also used reduction units integral to their design. The Cessna 175 used a geared unit which is part of the Continental GO-300 engine while the Helio Courier and several Beechcraft twins, among others, used the geared Lycoming GO-435 and GO-480. Many light sport aircraft use engines from Rotax such as the Rotax 912 which incorporates a geared reducer.
