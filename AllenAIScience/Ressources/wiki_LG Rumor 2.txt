The LG Rumor 2 and LG Script (LG Rumeur2 in the province of Quebec, and LG Rumour2 in the rest of Canada ) is a Sprint, Bell Mobility, Solo Mobile, Virgin Mobile USA and Virgin Mobile Canada feature phone manufactured by LG Electronics. It is available in black titanium, vibrant blue, purple, gray, and orange. The phones are offered by Sprint in Black, Blue, and Orange and were released in March 2009. The regular price of the phone is $249.99.
It is the follow-up of the LG Rumor (LX260) that came out in September 2007. The Rumor 2 has been updated from the original version. Although it is a bit bigger and slightly heavier, the QWERTY keyboard has been adjusted to have 4 full lines of the keyboard enabling more space for texting. The front keys have been polished to make what the critics say a glossier and more stylish look. Unlike the original Rumor, the LG Rumor 2 does not have video recording capabilities. It is suspected by the internet community that this was to prevent a loophole where customers could create a blank video with music on their computers and assign them as ring tones, thereby subverting any subscription or download fees. One downside of this phone is the internet browsing. Most websites will only allow half of the page to be viewed.


== Features ==


=== Main Features ===
Like the original Rumor, the Rumor 2 has many features including a slide-out QWERTY Keyboard in addition to the standard 12-button keypad, a 1.3-megapixel camera, and a 320x240 pixel screen. The QWERTY keyboard easily slides out to the right. The screen rotates as the keyboard opens up. One feature that is (surprisingly) missing, is a stopwatch.


=== Special Features ===
The digital camera is a 1.3-megapixel camera. It does not have an LED flash, but does include black and white, negative, and sepia color tones as well as various frames. It is very similar to the original Rumor camera. There is a self-timer, night mode functions/ brightness, and white balance controls. The Rumor 2 is Bluetooth-compatible and supports MP3 music formats and Sprint Navigation (Sprint’s map service).


==== Virgin Mobile Additions ====
Virgin Mobile added Ultimate Inbox to the LG Rumor 2 which includes several choices of push E-mail communication with support for Yahoo! Mail, Windows Live Hotmail, AOL Mail, Gmail, and an additional user-defined POP or IMAP account. There is also instant messaging support for AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, Google Talk, and Windows Live Messenger. According to the device's "About" screen the functionality is powered by MFluent. The LG Rumor 2 for Virgin Mobile is currently only available in black/silver/blue. Other additions to the phone include Virgin Mobile UI and VM default wallpapers and ringtones.


=== Storage ===
The phone can hold up to 600 contacts with additional numbers, notes, and email addresses. The phone supports up to 32 GB of storage via the MicroSD port on the right side of the phone.


=== Keyboard ===
The QWERTY keyboard has 5 rows of keys. The number keys now have their own row, as opposed to the Rumor keyboard where they shared a row across the top of the keyboard. The keys are still made with rubber. Unlike the original Rumor, the Rumor 2 keyboard includes arrow keys for easier navigation and an “enter” and a “back” button.


=== Entertainment ===
The Rumor 2 offers many different sources of entertainment. From the Sprint website, there are 101 games to pick from with different prices. Messaging is the main source of entertainment from the phone. The Rumor 2 is known for its convenient messaging. The music player on the phone can hold up to 4,000 songs using the MicroSD chip.
