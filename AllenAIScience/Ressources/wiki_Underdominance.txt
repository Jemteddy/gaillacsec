In genetics, underdominance is the opposite of overdominance. It is the selection against the mean of a population distribution, causing disruptive selection and divergent genotypes. Underdominance can also be described as homozygote advantage, wherein homozygous individuals have a higher fitness than heterozygous individuals.
