Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the APRT gene.


== Function ==
APRTase is an enzyme involved in the purine nucleotide salvage pathway. It functions as a catalyst in the reaction between adenine and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form AMP.
APRT is functionally related to hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT).


== Pathology ==
Deficiency purines APRT in human beings may lead to kidney stones formed of adenine and salts.
2,8-Dihydroxy-adenine urolithiasis is also known as "adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency".
Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency is an uncommon genetic disorder that often causes kidney stones, and in some patients kidney failure. More than 300 individuals with this disease have been reported world-wide but it is not known how common this medical problem truly is. Patients with the disease deficiency lack the enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and therefore have difficulties breaking down purines. This may result in the accumulation 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA) that is excreted by the kidneys. 2,8-DHA is poorly soluble in the urine leads to the formation of kidney stones and kidney injury.
Interestingly, up to 70% of affected patients, have red hair or relatives with this hair color.
