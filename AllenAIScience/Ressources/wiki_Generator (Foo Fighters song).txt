"Generator" is a Foo Fighters song, released as a single in 2000 from their third album There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The single was only released in Australia and also released as a limited edition single in Europe.
The song is particularly unique among the band's work because of Dave Grohl's implementation of the talk box in parts of the song. The usage of the device was partly inspired by Grohl's admiration of Peter Frampton and Joe Walsh, both of whom helped popularize it in the 1970s.
