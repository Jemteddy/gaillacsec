Sonic X is an anime series based on the Sonic the Hedgehog video game series. It originally ran consecutively on Sundays from April 6, 2003 to March 28, 2004 with a total of 52 episodes (collectively known as the Japanese "Series 1"). Episodes 53-78 (collectively known as "Series 2") never were aired on TV or released on DVD in Japan but were available through rental streaming services (episodes 53-78 were first broadcast on TV in some other countries before they aired on UK/US Television). For the English dub produced by 4Kids (which aired on FOX on the Saturday morning block FoxBox, later renamed 4Kids TV, from 2003 to 2006), episodes 1-52 were referred to as Seasons 1 and 2, each 26 episodes long, and episodes 53-78 were referred to as Season 3; but the Saga Set DVD releases split the episodes into six seasons, each containing 13 episodes. The airdates for TV Tokyo are listed on the left, while the airdates for the 4Kids English dub are on the right.
