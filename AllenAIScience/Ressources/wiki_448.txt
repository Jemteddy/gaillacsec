Year 448 (CDXLVIII) was a leap year starting on Thursday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Praetextatus and Zeno (or, less frequently, year 1201 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 448 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

=== By place ===


==== Roman Empire ====
Emperor Theodosius II sends an embassy to Attila the Hun; Anatolius, Roman general (magister militum) and responsible for the security of the Eastern frontier, achieves a peace treaty with the Huns in exchange for an annual tribute of 950 kilograms (2,100 lb) of gold per year.
Attila demands in the treaty the evacuation of the territory running from Singidunum (Belgrade, in Serbia) 500 kilometres (300 mi) east along the Danube to Novae (Svishtov, in Bulgaria). This depopulated buffer zone deprived the Romans of their natural defensive advantages.
Flavius Aetius suppresses the Bagaudae in Armorica (Gaul) and defeats the Salian Franks under king Chlodio near Arras (Belgica Secunda); the invaders are stopped around a river-crossing near Vicus Helena.
Theodosius II orders all non-Christian books burned.
