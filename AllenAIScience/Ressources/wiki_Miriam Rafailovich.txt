Patents:
"Patterning Method to Produce Nanoscale Magnetic Structures Using Polymer Self Assembly": We demonstrate that it is possible to produce a magnetic nanopattern on a substrate by using a self assembled co-polymer film as a mask. The scale of the pattern can be selected to range from several nanometers to micrometres. The pattern can be produced on any arbitrary magnetic film or interface and hence the method is applicable to metal multi-layers produced using ultra high vacuum or MBE. The use of this method to produce a working Giant Magneto Resistance device is demonstrated. Developers: Richard Gambino, Miriam Rafailovich, Jonathan Sokolov, Shaoming Zhu (1997).
"A Compatibilizer for Immiscible Polymer Blends" Developers: Miriam Rafailovich, Jonathan Sokolov, Benjamin Chu, Benjamin Hsaio A procedure was developed for the universal compatibilization of polymer blend thin films using surface functional zed exfoliated clays. The clays are non specific and compatiblization of general multi -component systems is possible (2000).
