A life form or lifeform is an entity or being that is living or alive or living. This is a list of articles that relate to physical, hypothetical, alleged, religious, or fictional life forms.
More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described.
In process philosophy, objects in the world or universe are layered or tiered in complexity. Living things are difficult to define, but life forms can be considered to be the most complex entities in the arena or environment in which they exist. As in process philosophy, this article brings together in a holistic manner, life forms from the diverse human intuitions found in experiences that include the ethical, religious, philosophical, scientific, and aesthetic.
