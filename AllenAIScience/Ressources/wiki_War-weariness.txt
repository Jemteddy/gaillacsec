War-weariness is the public or political disapproval for the continuation of a prolonged conflict or war. The causes normally involve the intensity of casualtiesâ€”financial, civilian, and military. It also occurs when a belligerent has the ability to easily leave the conflict yet continues to stay. War-weariness normally leads to a distrust in government or military leadership and can spark protest and anti-war movements. It can also be fueled when a belligerent is found guilty of war crimes, which can create domestic and international backlash. Rates of enlistment and the morale of the armed-forces are often affected by war-weariness.
War-weariness is less likely to appear in military dictatorships, especially those with heavy propaganda and censorship. More democratic nations have a better chance of having unpopular news of the war reach the masses, increasing their chance and level of war-weariness.
