Competing against Elitch Gardens in Denver and Darien Lake in Buffalo, Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park secured the winning bid to purchase Thunderbolt for $375,000. The cost to refurbish and ship the roller coaster was estimated at $425,000. An estimated 1,400 bolts were used during reconstruction of which 700 were special 14-inch (360 mm) bolts for holding sections of track together. On February 20, 2012, park administration went before the Garfield Board of County Commissioners to discuss plans of adding several new attractions. They announced on February 29, 2012, that Cliffhanger would be among the new attractions and would open in late spring 2012.
Cliffhanger opened on June 15, 2012, and became the highest-elevation roller coaster in the world, sitting 7,160 feet (2,180 m) above sea level on Iron Mountain. The coaster is situated on a hillside overlooking Glenwood Canyon with views of the Colorado River more than 1,400 feet (430 m) below.
