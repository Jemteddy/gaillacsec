Asthenozoospermia (or asthenospermia) is the medical term for reduced sperm motility. Complete asthenozoospermia, that is, 100% immotile spermatozoa in the ejaculate, is reported at a frequency of 1 of 5000 men. Causes of complete asthenozoospermia include metabolic deficiencies, ultrastructural abnormalities of the sperm flagellum (see Primary ciliary dyskinesia) and necrozoospermia.
It decreases the sperm quality and is therefore one of the major causes of infertility or reduced fertility in men. A method to increase the chance of pregnancy is ICSI. The percentage of viable spermatozoa in complete asthenozoospermia varies between 0 and 100%.
