The Gippsland languages are a family of Pamaâ€“Nyungan languages of Australia. They are spoken in the Gippsland region, the southernmost part of mainland Australia, on the Bass Strait. There are three rather distant branches; these often considered single languages, though the dialects of Gaanay are sometimes counted separately:
Gaanay (Kurnai): Muk-thang, Nulit, Thangquai, Bidhawal
Dhudhuroa
Pallanganmiddang
All are now extinct. The Gippsland languages, especially Gaanay, have phonotactics that are unusual for mainland Australian languages, but characteristic of Tasmanian languages.
