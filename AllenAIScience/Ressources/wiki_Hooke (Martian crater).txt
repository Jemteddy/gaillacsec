Hooke Crater is an impact crater in the Argyre quadrangle on Mars at 45.2°S and 44.4°W and is 139.0 km in diameter. Its name was approved in 1973, and it was named after Robert Hooke. Some of the dunes have gullies on them. While these gullies may be a bit different then ones found on crater walls and other steep slopes, they have been thought by some to be caused by flowing water.
