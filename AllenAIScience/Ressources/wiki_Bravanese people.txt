The Bravanese people, also known as the Barawani, are a group inhabiting Somalia.


== Origins ==
As their name suggests, the Bravanese hail from Brava (Barawa), a port town on the southeastern coast of Somalia.
The population's members trace their origins to diverse groups, notably Yemeni, Omani, Somali and Persian migrants. Some families also have ancestry from the coastal Bantu (from whom the Chimwiini language was adopted) and the Eyle Khoisanoid hunter-gather ethnic minorities of southern Somalia.


== Language ==
The Bravanese speak the Bravanese language (Chimwiini), a variant of the Bantu Swahili language.
Many also speak Somali, which is an Afro-Asiatic language either as a first or second language.
