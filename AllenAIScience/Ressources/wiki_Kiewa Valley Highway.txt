The Kiewa Valley Highway is a minor highway of 80 kilometres (50 mi) which traverses the Kiewa Valley near the alpine regions of Victoria, Australia. In the 1950s the road was sealed and realigned to Mount Beauty to permit the transport of materials for the construction of the Kiewa Hydroelectric Scheme. From Mount Beauty the road continues as the Bogong High Plains Road, a winding and twisty route via the alpine resort of Falls Creek, which terminates at its junction with the Omeo Highway at Shannonvale south of Glen Valley.
