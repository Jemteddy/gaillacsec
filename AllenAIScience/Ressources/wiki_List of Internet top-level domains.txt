This list of Internet top-level domain extensions contains all top-level domains, i.e. the domains in the DNS root zone of the Domain Name System of the Internet.
The official list of all top-level domains is maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). IANA also oversees the approval process for new proposed top-level domains. As of November 2015, the root domain contains 1096 top-level domains, while a few have been retired and are no longer functional.


== TypesEdit ==

As of 2015, IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:
infrastructure top-level domain (ARPA)
generic top-level domains (gTLD)
restricted generic top-level domains (grTLD)
sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)
country code top-level domains (ccTLD)
test top-level domains (tTLD)


== Original top-level domainsEdit ==
Seven generic top-level domains were created early in the development of the Internet, and pre-date the creation of ICANN in 1998.
Name: DNS name
Entity: intended use
Notes: general remarks
IDN: support for internationalized domain names (IDN)
DNSSEC: presence of DS records for Domain Name System Security Extensions

== Internationalized generic top-level domainsEdit ==
All of these TLDs are internationalized domain names (IDN) and support second-level IDNs.

Notes: general remarks
IDN: support for internationalized domain names (IDN)

== Test TLDsEdit ==
ICANN created a set of top-level Internationalized domain names in October 2007 for the purpose of testing the use of IDNA in the root zone and within those domains. These testing domains were abolished on 31 October 2013. Each of these TLDs encoded a word meaning "test" in the respective language.
Each of these domains contained only one site with the word "example" encoded in the respective script and language. These example.test sites were test wikis used by ICANN.
