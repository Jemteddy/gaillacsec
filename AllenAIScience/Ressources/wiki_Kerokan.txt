Kerokan is a traditional Indonesian folk cure, wherein a coin or ladle is drawn across the back. This action supposedly helps to release "wind" from the body by increasing blood flow near the skin's surface. The practice can also cause marking or injury.
Another belief is that the coin serves as an attempt to draw the bad spirits that are making you feel sick out of your body (since bad spirits are known to be attracted to money). The redder or darker the marks are, then the sicker you actually are.
The procedure starts from your neck, arms, chest to your stomach, back and down your legs.
