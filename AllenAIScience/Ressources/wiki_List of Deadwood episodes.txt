Writing credits: Series creator and executive producer David Milch is explicitly credited with writing five of the show's 36 episodes; however, he did contribute significantly to the writing of almost every episode, frequently completely re-writing episode drafts written by other writers. The credited writer for any given episode is usually one of Milch's staff writers who helped him develop storylines.
