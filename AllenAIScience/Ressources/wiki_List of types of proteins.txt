List of proteins contains large amounts of information concerning genes and proteins. Gene sequencing efforts and genome sequencing projects have led to the creation of many gene databases and attempts to organize all of the available information. Classifications may be based on protein structure as in the CATH database and the Structural Classification of Proteins database (SCOP). The list is based on the biological categories described in the GO Slims list for "GOA and whole proteome analysis". Modifications are being made as needed, but an effort is being made to keep these "top level" categories limited in number.
The original GOA and whole proteome analysis slim contains many suggested “synonyms” and subcategories for the following categories.


== Biological Process Unknown ==
"Used for the annotation of gene products whose process is not known or cannot be inferred."
Proteins with no known biological function can be categorized according to protein structural criteria (distinctive structural domains), source organism or subcellular location.


=== Structural Categories ===
Proteins with unknown functions can sometimes be categorized according to their structural features if they contain a recognizable protein domain.
See Protein domains.


=== Organism Categories ===
If the only thing known about a protein is the organism that produces it, then it can enjoy (as a last resort) being categorized according to the organism.

=== Cellular Component ===
"The part of a cell of which a gene product is a component; for purpose of GO includes the extracellular environment of cells; a gene product may be a component of one or more parts of a cell; this term includes gene products that are parts of macromolecular complexes, by the definition that all members of a complex normally copurify under all except extreme conditions."


==== Unlocalized Protein Complex ====
"Used as a holding place for cellular components whose precise localization is, as yet, unknown, or has not been determined by GO (the latter is the major reason for nodes to have this parent); this term should not be used for annotation of gene products." See also the cellular component term 'cellular component unknown’ (below).
