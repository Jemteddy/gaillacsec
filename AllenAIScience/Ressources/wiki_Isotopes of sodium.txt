There are twenty recognized isotopes of sodium, ranging from 18Na to 37Na and two isomers (22mNa and 24mNa). 23Na is the only stable (and the only primordial) isotope. As such, it is considered a monoisotopic element and it has a standard atomic mass: 7001229897692800000♠22.98976928(2) u. Sodium has two radioactive cosmogenic isotopes (22Na, half-life = 2.605 years; and 24Na, half-life ≈ 15 hours). With the exception of those two, all other isotopes have half-lives under a minute, most under a second. The least stable is 18Na, with a half-life of 6979129999999999999♠1.3(4)×10−21 seconds.
Acute neutron radiation exposure (e.g., from a nuclear criticality accident) converts some of the stable 23Na in human blood plasma to 24Na. By measuring the concentration of this isotope, the neutron radiation dosage to the victim can be computed.
22Na is a positron-emitting isotope with a remarkably long half-life. It is used to create test-objects and point-sources for positron emission tomography.

=== NotesEdit ===
Values marked # are not purely derived from experimental data, but at least partly from systematic trends. Spins with weak assignment arguments are enclosed in parentheses.
Uncertainties are given in concise form in parentheses after the corresponding last digits. Uncertainty values denote one standard deviation, except isotopic composition and standard atomic mass from IUPAC, which use expanded uncertainties.


== Sodium-24Edit ==
Sodium-24 is one of the most important isotopes. It is radioactive and created from common sodium-23 by neutron bombardment. With a 15-hour half life, 24Na decays to 24Mg by emission of an electron and two gamma rays. Exposure of the human body to intense neutron flux creates 24Na in blood plasma. Measurements of its quantity are used to determine the absorbed radiation dose of the patient. This is used to determine the level of medical treatment required.
When the sodium-potassium alloy is used as a coolant in nuclear reactors, 24Na is created, which makes the coolant radioactive. When the 24Na decays, it causes a buildup of magnesium in the coolant. Since the half life is short, the 24Na portion of the coolant ceases to be radioactive within a few days after removal from the reactor.
