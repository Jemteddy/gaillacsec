The sport of athletics is defined by the many events which make up its competition programmes. All events within the sport are forms of running, walking, jumping or throwing. These events are divided into the sub-sports of track and field, road running, racewalking and cross country running.
The Olympic athletics programme has played a significant role in shaping the most common events in the sport. The IAAF World Championships in Athletics is the foremost World Championship event, holding the vast majority of World Championship-level events within the competition. A small number of events, such as the 60 metres, are exclusive to the IAAF World Indoor Championships.
Two further, separate World Championship events are held for their specific events: the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships and the IAAF World Cross Country Championships. Cross country is one of many events which have appeared at Olympics but no longer form part of the Olympic athletics schedule. Some events, such as the mile run, remain very popular at competitions, despite having neither Olympic nor World Championship status.
