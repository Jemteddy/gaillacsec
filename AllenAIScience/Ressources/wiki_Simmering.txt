Simmering is a food preparation technique in which foods are cooked in hot liquids kept just below the boiling point of water (which is 100 °C or 212 °F at average sea level air pressure), but higher than poaching temperature. To keep a pot simmering, one brings it to a boil and then reduces the heat to a point where the formation of bubbles has almost ceased, typically a water temperature of about 94 °C (200 °F).


== In food preparationEdit ==
Simmering ensures gentler treatment than boiling to prevent food from toughening and/or breaking up. Simmering is usually a rapid and efficient method of cooking. Food that has simmered in milk or cream instead of water is sometimes referred to as creamed. The appropriate simmering temperature is a topic of debate among chefs, with some contending that a simmer is as low as 82 °C (180 °F).


=== Japanese cuisineEdit ===
In Japanese cuisine, simmering is considered one of the four essential cooking techniques.


=== American cuisineEdit ===
Food prepared in a crockpot is simmered. Examples include stews, chili, soups, etc.

=== Dutch and Flemish cuisineEdit ===

In traditional Dutch and Flemish cuisine, less tender cuts of beef are simmered during several hours to obtain Carbonade flamande. Traditionally a small flame is used, fed by burning oil. On modern stoves, the source of heat is put very low, or a simmering plate is used to diminish the heat. Usually a cast iron pan is used with a thick bottom. The meat is ready if it can be easily torn apart into threads. 


=== Modern stovesEdit ===
Some modern gas ranges are equipped with a simmering burner, with such burners usually located at the rear of the range. Many electric ranges have a simmer setting.
