Disc-winged bats are a small group of bats of the family Thyropteridae. They are found in Central and South America, usually in moist tropical rain forests. It is a very small family, consisting of a single genus with five species.
The name comes from the suction cups found at the base of the thumb and under the heel of these animals, similar to those found in Sucker-footed Bats. These structures help them to cling smooth surfaces, and to remain, for example, inside young coiled banana and Heliconia leaves, where they roost.
They can also be recognized by their reduced thumbs, which are enclosed by the wing membranes, and their funnel-shaped ears. They have brownish to black fur, and roost in small groups, or singly. They are insectivorous and can live in many different kinds of environments.
