The Dean of Newcastle is the head (primus inter pares – first among equals) and chair of the chapter of canons, the ruling body of Newcastle Cathedral. The dean and chapter are based at the Cathedral Church of Saint Nicholas, Newcastle upon Tyne. Before 2000 the post was designated as a provost, which was then the equivalent of a dean at most English cathedrals. The cathedral is the mother church of the Diocese of Newcastle and seat of the Bishop of Newcastle. The current dean is Chris Dalliston.
