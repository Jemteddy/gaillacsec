In biology, a lumen (from Latin lÅ«men, meaning "an opening"; plural lumina) is the inside space of a tubular structure, such as an artery or intestine. By extension, the term lumen is also used to describe the inside space of a cellular component or structure, such as the endoplasmic reticulum.


== Examples of luminaEdit ==
The interior of a vessel, such as the central space in an artery or vein through which blood flows.
The interior of the gastrointestinal tract 
The pathways of the bronchi in the lungs
The interior of renal tubules and urinary collecting ducts
The pathways of the female genital tract, starting with a single pathway of the vagina, splitting up in two lumina in the uterus, both of which continue through the fallopian tubes
Within a cell, the inner membrane space of a thylakoid, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, mitochondria or microtubule.


== Transluminal proceduresEdit ==
Transluminal procedures are procedures occurring through lumina, including:
Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery in the lumina of, for example the stomach, vagina, bladder or colon
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in the lumina of blood vessels
