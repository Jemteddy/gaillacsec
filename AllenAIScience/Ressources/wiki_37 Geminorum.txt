37 Geminorum has many physical properties in common with the Sun and is one of the nearest solar analogs. Due to this fact some scientists believe that the prospects for life in its vicinity are good. In September 2003, 37 Geminorum was identified by astrobiologist Margaret Turnbull from the University of Arizona in Tucson as one of the most promising nearby candidates for hosting life, based on her analysis of the HabCat list of stars.
