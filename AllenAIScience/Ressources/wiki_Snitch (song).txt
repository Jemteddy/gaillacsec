"Snitch" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Henry Adaso of About.com called "Snitch" a "potent single" and complimented the musical growth shown by Trice on the song, noted that it "signal[s] Trice's transition from the cartoonish Slim Shady accomplice that once underwhelmed... to a sole survivor." However, in his review for Stylus Magazine, Jonathan Bradley called "Snitch" "an enjoyable but inessential track": he also felt it to be unoriginal, writing that it "sounds like every other Akon guest appearance on the market" and that Trice was "poorly served by hooking up with the hot guests of the moment".
