In his 2003 book In the Blink of an Eye, Parker proposes that the Cambrian Explosion, the sudden diversification in animal fossil forms at the start of the Cambrian Period, was due to the development of the vision faculty and the consequent intensification of predation. In particular he concludes that predation with vision led to the development of hard body parts, explaining why the fossil record displayed the Cambrian Explosion at this point in time. The theory received varied reviews; while some were critical of the book and its central hypothesis, the majority of others were highly positive, with comments including:
His 2006 book, Seven Deadly Colours, Parker describes the variety of methods of producing colour that have evolved in nature, and their implications for animal lifestyles.
Parker is also an agnostic. His 2009 book The Genesis Enigma argues that the Book of Genesis (and especially chapter 1) is surprisingly accurate and in accord with science. This caused him to conclude that the author of Genesis might have been inspired by God, although his work since demonstrates a neutral stance on religion.
