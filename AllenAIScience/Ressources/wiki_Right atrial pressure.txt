Right atrial pressure (RAP) is the pressure of blood in the right atrium of the heart. RAP reflects the amount of blood returning to the heart and the ability of the heart to pump the blood into the arterial system. RAP is often nearly identical to central venous pressure (CVP), however the two terms are not identical, as right atrial pressure is the pressure in the right atrium. CVP and RAP can differ when venous tone is altered. This can be graphically depicted as changes in the slope of the venous return plotted against right atrial pressure (where central venous pressure increases, but right atrial pressure stays the same; VR = CVP-RAP).


== Factors affecting RAP ==
Factors that increase RAP include:
Hypervolemia
Forced exhalation
Tension pneumothorax
Heart failure
Pleural effusion
Decreased cardiac output
Cardiac tamponade
Mechanical ventilation and the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
Pulmonary Hypertension
Pulmonary Embolism
Factors that decrease RAP include:
Hypovolemia
Deep inhalation
Distributive shock
