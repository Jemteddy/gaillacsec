Shanghai Metal Exchange (SHME), one of the national level futures exchanges of China, was established on 28 May 1992. SHME is a non-profit, self-regulating corporation. The exchange was created for trading in non-ferrous metals and currently contracts for several non-ferrous metals including copper, aluminum, lead, zinc, tin, and nickel.
SHME is located in the city of Shanghai and its geographical location bridges the time gap between London Metal Exchange and New York Mercantile Exchange markets, thus enabling traders across the world to have a 24-hour access to futures contracts of non-ferrous metals. SHME is currently the largest non-ferrous metals futures exchange in China and the third largest exchange of its kind in the world.
