Compressed hydrogen (CH2, CGH2 or CGH2) is the gaseous state of the element hydrogen kept under pressure. Compressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for mobile hydrogen storage in hydrogen vehicles. It is used as a fuel gas.


== InfrastructureEdit ==
Compressed hydrogen is used in hydrogen pipeline transport and in compressed hydrogen tube trailer transport.
