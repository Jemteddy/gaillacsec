Biogical processes are the processes vital for a living organism to live. Biological processes are made up of any number chemical reactions or other events that result in chemical transformation. Metabolism and homeostasis are examples.
Regulation of biological processes occurs where any process is modulated in its frequency, rate or extent. Biological processes are regulated by many means; examples include the control of gene expression, protein modification or interaction with a protein or substrate molecule.
Physiological process, those processes specifically pertinent to the functioning of integrated living units: cells, tissues, organs, limbs, and organisms.
Reproduction
Digestion
Response to stimulus: a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus.
Interaction between organisms. the processes by which an organism has an observable effect on another organism of the same or different species.
Also: cell growth, cellular differentiation, fermentation, fertilisation, germination, tropism, hybridisation, metamorphosis, morphogenesis, photosynthesis, transpiration.
