Laura Mercier Cosmetics is a cosmetics line that was co-founded by Laura Mercier, a French makeup artist. The brand's cosmetics are produced and marketed by Gurwitch Products.
The brand was established in 1996 by Laura Mercier in partnership with former Neiman Marcus executive Janet Gurwitch, the then-CEO of Gurwitch Products. From the outset, Laura Mercier Cosmetic's goal was to offer "high-quality, natural-looking makeup products for all skin tones and types", according to the Wall Street Journal. The brand became known for its focus on products to create what it calls the "flawless face", a concept derived from Mercier's reputation for promoting naturalistic makeup. In 2012, it became the official cosmetics brand of Project Runway All Stars Second Season. The company was sold to Alticor, the parent company of Amway in 2006, with assurances that creative control would stay the same.
