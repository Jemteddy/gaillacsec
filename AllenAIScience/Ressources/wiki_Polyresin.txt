Polyresin is a resin compound generally used for statues, figurines, bobbleheads and decorative furniture. It is a sturdy material that can be intricately molded, allowing a great level of detail with consistent texture.
Additives can be incorporated into the compound to enhance the material's strength, reduce its weight, add heat stability, decorative effects, and so on. Polyresin is also compatible with a large range of different finishes, including paint and metallic finishes, which is why many decorative pieces are made from this material.
One form of polyresin often used is Alabastrite. It is a stone-based material, easy to sculpt, takes paint well, and has a similar appearance to porcelain and pottery.
