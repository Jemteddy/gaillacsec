AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network.


== History ==

AllMusic was launched in 1991 by Michael Erlewine of All Media Guide (later became All Media Network). The aim was to "[compile] discographic information on every artist who's made a record since Enrico Caruso gave the industry its first big boost". Its first reference book was published the following year.
When first released onto the Internet, AMG predated the World Wide Web and was first available as a Gopher site.
The AMG consumer web properties AllMusic.com, AllMovie.com and AllGame.com were sold by Rovi in July 2013 to All Media Network, LLC. All Media Network, LLC. was formed by the original founders of SideReel.com and Ackrell Capital.
