The hook-billed hermit (Glaucis dohrnii) is an endangered species of hummingbird in the Trochilidae family. It is found in humid forests in eastern Brazil, with recent records from the states of Esp√≠rito Santo and Bahia only. It resembles the far commoner rufous-breasted hermit, but has a straighter bill and lacks rufous in the tail. It is threatened by habitat loss and changing migration patterns.
