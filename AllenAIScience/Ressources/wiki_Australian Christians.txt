The Australian Christians is a political party in Australia founded in 2011. Registered with the Australian Electoral Commission on 15 December 2011, they aim to represent Christian values, appealing to the 2.7 million voters who go to church at least once a month. It was formed when the Victorian and Western Australian branches of the Christian Democratic Party (CDP) voted to form a new party. The party has endorsed senate candidates in Western Australia, Victoria and Tasmania and plans to expand into South Australia and Queensland. The party has decided not to operate in New South Wales, where the CDP has two seats in the Legislative Council.
The party contested the 2012 Melbourne state by-election on July 21, and received about 1 percent of the vote.
The party contested the Western Australian state election on 9 March 2013, and received 1.95% of the vote.
The party has been involved in Glenn Druery's Minor Party Alliance.
