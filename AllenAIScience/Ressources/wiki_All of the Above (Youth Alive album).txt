All of the Above is Youth Alive Western Australia's third praise and worship album, and first live recording in recent years. The album is varied in style - along with typical praise and worship songs, the album also features the faux hard rock sound on "Shout Your Glory", a cover of Jimmy Eat World's "Sweetness", and a generic hip-hop "remix" of Hillsong United's "Tell The World". The CD comes with a free bonus DVD which includes video of six of the songs from the live recording, a "mockumentary" of the live recording and printable sheet music of some of the songs.
