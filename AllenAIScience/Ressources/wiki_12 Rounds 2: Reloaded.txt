Tyler Foster of DVD Talk rated it 1.5/5 stars and wrote, "Even the world's most committed Randy Orton fan won't get anything out of 12 Rounds 2, a dull rehash of a million other, better action movies that saddles Orton with an uninteresting character." David Johnson of DVD Verdict compared it negatively to the first film and wrote, "With 12 Rounds 2 and its dearth of compelling derring-do, we're left with Randy Orton grunting and running an obstacle course. No thanks."
