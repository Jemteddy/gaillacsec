Phorone, or diisopropylidene acetone, is a yellow crystalline substance with a geranium odor. It is a self-condensation product of acetone. It can also be obtained from certain camphor compounds.
Phorone is combustible when exposed to heat or flame.
Crude phorone can be purified by repeated recrystallization from ethanol or ether, in which it is soluble.
