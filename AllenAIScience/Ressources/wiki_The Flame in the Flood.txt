The only companion that the player will have will be a dog called Aesop, who can sense danger and fetch supplies. The player must pay attention to Scout's needs such as her energy, thirst, and warmth, and not paying attention to them can result in death. Once the player dies, the death cannot be undone. There will be a crafting system allowing the player to create new items. They will also need to scavenge areas for valuable items. Factors such as the weather will impact the gameplay. The player will be able to create insulated clothing to protect them from the cold. One of the developers referred to it as a "travelling survival game".
