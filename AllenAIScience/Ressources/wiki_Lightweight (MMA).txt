The lightweight division in mixed martial arts refers to a number of different weight classes:
The UFC lightweight division with an upper limit at 155 lb (70.3 kg)
The Pancrase lightweight division, which formerly limited competitors to 152 lb (69 kg) now revised to 155 lb (70 kg)
The Shooto lightweight division, which limits competitors to 143 lb (65 kg)
The PFC's (defunct) and EliteXC's (defunct) lightweight divisions, which limited competitors to 160 lb (73 kg)
The SRC's (defunct) lightweight division, which formerly limited competitors to 154 lb (70 kg) revised to 155 lb (70 kg)
The Dream's (defunct) lightweight division, which limited competitors to 154 lb (70 kg)


== Ambiguity and clarificationEdit ==
For the sake of uniformity, most American mixed martial arts media outlets consider Lightweight competitors to be between 146 and 155 lb (66 and 70 kg). This encompasses The Shooto Welterweight division (154 lb / 70 kg).
The UFC's lightweight division was reinstated at UFC 58 after falling into disuse following UFC 49. Sean Sherk, a former welterweight contender, defeated Kenny Florian at UFC 64, becoming the first UFC lightweight champion since 2002.
The lightweight limit, as defined by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and the Association of Boxing Commissions is 155 lb (70 kg).
