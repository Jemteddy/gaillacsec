Badureliya Sports Club is a first class cricket team in Sri Lanka. In late 2008, the club threatened to boycott the Sri Lankan domestic tournaments due to their objections to being relegated to Tier B from their position in Tier A. The club later backed down from their stance, and defeated Nondescripts Cricket Club by an innings and two runs.
They play their home matches at Surrey Village Cricket Ground, Maggona.
