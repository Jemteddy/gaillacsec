CKXG-FM is a Canadian radio station broadcasting from Grand Falls-Windsor at 102.3 MHz FM, with a repeater at 101.3 MHz, also in Grand Falls-Windsor. The 101.3 frequency serves as a fill-in because the 102.3 frequency is weak in the downtown area and nearby Bishop's Falls. The station launched sometime in the 1960s as CJCN at 680 kHz AM, and is currently owned by Newcap Broadcasting. In 1977, after Don Jamieson bought out Geoff Stirling's interest in Radio CJYQ-930 Ltd, CJCN was renamed CIYQ. In 1983, Jamieson sold his company to CHUM Limited. In 1989, CHUM Limited sold the "Q" stations to Newcap. In 1990, CIYQ's program feed changed from CJYQ to CKIX and changed its call letters again to CKXG. In 1999, with the AM equipment nearing the end of its life cycle, CKXG jumped from 680 AM to 102.3 FM. In the early 2000s, CKXG re-branded from KIXX Country to Magic 102, and shortly afterwards to 102.3 K-ROCK. The other two KIXX Country stations outside of St. John's, CKXD in Gander and CKXX in Corner Brook, were also branded with the "Magic" name and then subsequently to K-ROCK.
On September 29, 2011, Newcap received approval to decrease CKXG-FM's average effective radiated power (ERP) from 24,000 to 17,000 watts, increasing the maximum ERP from 24,000 to 36,000 watts, decreasing the antennaâ€™s effective height above average terrain from 236.7 to 96.6 metres and relocating the antenna site.
