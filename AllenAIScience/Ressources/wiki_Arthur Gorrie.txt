Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre is a high security Remand Centre for males, primarily accommodating individuals who a Judge or Magistrate has ordered must be held in custody as they await, and during, trial. The centre is located on the Ipswich Motorway at Wacol in the western suburbs of Brisbane, Australia. The centre's Maximum Security Unit was closed on 1 March 2013, with maximum security inmates moved to other maximum security facilities within the State.
The centre is relatively modern with TVs, showers and toilets in all rooms and shared dining facilities.
Managed by the GEO Group Australia, the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre is the second of Queensland's privately operated non-government prisons, sharing that notation with the Southern Queensland Correctional Centre.
