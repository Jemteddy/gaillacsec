EMBO publishes four peer-reviewed journals: The EMBO Journal, EMBO Reports, Molecular Systems Biology, and EMBO Molecular Medicine. These span a broad spectrum of molecular biology topics and reflect how science is changing the world.


== EMBO Awards ==
Annually awarded, the EMBO Gold Medal recognises significant contributions of European researchers to the advancement of science. EMBO also awards grants to scientists.
EMBO also promotes Europe as a research location to foreign researchers, and increases awareness of options for research and training in the life sciences in Europe. This strengthens ties with scientific communities worldwide.
