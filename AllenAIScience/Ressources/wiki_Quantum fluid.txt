A quantum fluid can refer to a cluster of valence electrons moving together after they undergo fermionic condensation.
Under extremely high pressures and low temperatures electrons may condense into a quantum fluid. In such a state, electrical current can theoretically flow forever with a complete absence of voltage, meaning that its electric potential does not change, as in a superconductor. Like superconductivity this quantum fluid state is the result of a phase transition.
Quantum fluids exhibit the remarkable property of remaining liquid at absolute zero temperature and zero pressure. This effect arises from their large zero-point energy and the small interatomic forces, both of which prevent the formation of a solid phase.
A quantum fluid can also refer to a superfluid (made up of atoms).
