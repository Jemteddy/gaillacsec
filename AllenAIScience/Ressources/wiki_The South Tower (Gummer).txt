The South Tower is an outdoor sculpture by American artist Don Gummer (born 1941). It is located on the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) campus, which is near downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, and is owned by the artist. The precarious, leaning sculpture made of frosted aluminum is meant to represent the moment before the South Tower of the World Trade Center fell in the attacks of September 11, 2001.


== Description ==
The South Tower is an abstract, frosted aluminum rectangular sculpture measuring 10’ x 3’ x 2’. The grate-like design of each section is carried through the sculpture creating a leaning, S-shaped structure. Each section is composed of 11 straight bars of aluminum. Four bolts secure the artwork to the circular concrete base.
The South Tower is signed “Don Gummer 2008” on the front of the artwork, at the top of the bottom element.


== Artist Statement on The South Tower ==
“It’s a tall, rectangular, vertically-louvered sculpture that starts to come apart at the top. It’s very simple. [I was] on my way to the studio when the (Sept. 11, 2001) attack occurred, and I saw the South Tower fall. It’s seared in my memory.” 2011
