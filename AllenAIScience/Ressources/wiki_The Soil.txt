== HistoryEdit ==
Its inception came about in 2003 when all the members met in high school during jam sessions. Back then the group was known as Particles of the Soil and consisted of more than 25 members. As years passed, some members departed due to other engagements. In 2010, the group was down to four members: Buhlebendalo Mda (vocalist), Ntsika Ngxanga (main composer and vocalist), Luphindo (beatboxer and vocalist) & Motif Records signee Samkelo Lelethu Mdolomba, commonly known by his stage name, Samthing Soweto. Mdolomba was involved during the recording process of the group's first album, however, due to contractual disputes, Samkelo decided to leave and form the contemporary jazz group The Fridge where he serves as the lead vocalist.
In 2011, The Soil released their self-titled debut LP The Soil which achieved platinum status, selling over 50,000 copies. Their sophomore album Nostalgic Moments was released digitally on iTunes on 15 September 2014. It was made available for hard copy purchase on 22 September 2014. The album includes guest appearances by the Grammy award-winning Ladysmith Black Mambazo and multiple award-winning hip hop artist Khuli Chana.
