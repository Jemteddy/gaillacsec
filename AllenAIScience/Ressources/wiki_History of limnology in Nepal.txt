== Field laboratory ==
"In April 1977 work was started on a laboratory office building. This was ready for use in September 1977. The building offers sufficient space, a good laboratory bench with power outlets, etc. A library room is also provided. However, the building might prove unsatisfactory for continuing activities if leakage problems are not attended to."
Upon establishment of the laboratory some of the equipment and tools included were a stereo microscope, microscope, top pan balance, "a Hachkit for simple chemical analysis and a refrigerator".
Later other equipment was procured including a hydrographic winch, rubber dinghy, portable echosounder, laboratory glassware, and specimen jars.
