Gliese 649 is a red dwarf star in the constellation of Hercules, located roughly 34 light years from the Sun. The star has been found to host an extrasolar planet.


== A planetary companionEdit ==
According to Johnson et al. (2010) a Saturn-mass planet has been detected around the red dwarf star. It yields 32.8% of Jupiter's mass and is located 1.15 astronomical units from its star in eccentric orbit (e=0.3). Assuming a luminosity of 4.5% that of the Sun, the habitable zone is located at 0.21 AUs, thus the planet should be as cold as if it were located at 5.5 AUs from a Solar-like star. Also accounting different periastron and apastron positions of 0.8 and 1.49 AUs respectively, the planet could likely show seasonal temperature changes.
