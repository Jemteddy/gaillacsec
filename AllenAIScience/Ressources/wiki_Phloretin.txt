Phloretin is a dihydrochalcone, a type of natural phenols. It can be found in apple tree leaves and the Manchurian apricot.


== Pharmacology ==
Phloretin inhibits the active transport of glucose into cells by SGLT1 and SGLT2, though the inhibition is weaker than by its glycoside phlorizin. Orally consumed phlorizin is nearly entirely converted into phloretin by hydrolytic enzymes in the small intestine. An important effect of this is the inhibition of glucose absorption by the small intestine and the inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption. Phloretin also inhibits a variety of urea transporters. It induces urea loss and diuresis when coupled with high protein diets.
Phloretin has been found to inhibit GLUT2.


== Metabolism ==
Phloretin hydrolase uses phloretin and water to produce phloretate and phloroglucinol.


== Glycosides ==
Phlorizin is the 2'-glucoside of phloretin.
Naringin dihydrochalcone is a diglycoside of phloretin.
