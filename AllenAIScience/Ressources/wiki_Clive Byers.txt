Clive Byers is a British bird artist.
His illustrations have appeared in a number of well-known and popular bird identification guides, including Birds of the Western Palearctic and the Buntings and Sparrows volume of the Helm Identification Guides series.
His illustrations have an unusual style, distinct from most of his contemporaries, in which the technical details of the birds are invariably depicted accurately, but also often with somewhat cartoon-like facial expressions.
