The Four Continents Figure Skating Championships (4CC) is an annual figure skating competition. The International Skating Union established it in 1999 to provide skaters representing non-European countries with a similar competition to the much older European Figure Skating Championships. The event's name refers to Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania (four of the continents represented in the Olympic rings, omitting Europe). Medals are awarded in the disciplines of men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dancing. Historically, the 4CC has been dominated by just four countries â€“ Canada, China, Japan, and the United States, who have won a combined 201 out of 204 possible medals. Kazakhstan, South Korea, and Uzbekistan are the only other countries to have placed in the 4CC, winning one gold medal each.
