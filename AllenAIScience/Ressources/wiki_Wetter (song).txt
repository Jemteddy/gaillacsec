"Wetter" is a song by American rapper Twista off his seventh album Category F5 and released as the first single. The song features the singer Erika Shevon, and was produced by The Legendary Traxster. It is sometimes referred to as the second part to the song "Get It Wet" off of his Adrenaline Rush album. It was released as a Digital Download on February 24, 2009. The radio version is remixed. The song contains elements from Janet Jackson's 1994 hit Any Time, Any Place. It is a straightforward slow jam, with Shevon's vocal chorus punctuating Twista's two verses. The 'calling you daddy' section serves as both an intro and outro. There is a freestyle by Lil Wayne & Shanell called "Wayne On Me" from Wayne's 2009 mixtape "No Ceilings." This song is Twista's highest-charting single since Girl Tonite (2005).
