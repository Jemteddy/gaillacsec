Justice tourism or Solidarity tourism is an ethic for travelling that holds as its central goals the creation of economic opportunities for the local community, positive cultural exchange between guest and host through one-on-one interaction, the protection of the environment, and political/historical education.
It has been promoted particularly in Bosnia and Palestine, especially by the Alternative Tourism Group and the Christian initiative in Palestine.
