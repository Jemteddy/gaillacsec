In science and mathematics, an open problem or an open question is a known problem which can be accurately stated, and which is assumed to have an objective and verifiable solution, but which has not yet been solved (no solution for it is known).
In the history of science, some of these supposed open problems were "solved" by means of showing that they were not, after all, well-defined. Many open problems in mathematics are in fact concerned with the question whether a certain definition is or is not consistent.
Two notable examples in mathematics that have been solved and closed by researchers in the late twentieth century are Fermat's Last Theorem and the four color theorem. An important open mathematics problem solved in the early 21st century is the Poincaré conjecture.
Important open problems exist in all scientific fields. For example, one of the most important open problems in biochemistry is the protein structure prediction problem – how to predict a protein's structure from its sequence.
