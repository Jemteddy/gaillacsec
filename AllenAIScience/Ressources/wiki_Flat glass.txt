Flat glass, sheet glass or plate glass is a type of glass, initially produced in plane form, commonly used for windows, glass doors, transparent walls, and windshields. For modern architectural and automotive applications, the flat glass is sometimes bent after production of the plane sheet. Flat glass stands in contrast to container glass (used for bottles, jars, cups) and glass fiber (used for thermal insulation, in fiberglass composites, and optical communication).
Glass for flat glass has a higher magnesium oxide and sodium oxide content than container glass, and a lower silica, calcium oxide, and aluminium oxide content. (From the lower soluble oxide content comes the better chemical durability of container glass against water, which is required especially for storage of beverages and food).
Most flat glass is soda-lime glass, produced by the float glass process. Other processes for making flat glass include:
Rolling (Rolled plate glass, Figure rolled glass)
Overflow downdraw method
Blown plate method
Broad sheet method
Window crown glass technique
Cylinder blown sheet method
Fourcault process
Machine drawn cylinder sheet method
Plate polishing

The term plate glass universities is used in the United Kingdom to describe a group – or generation – of universities (in an acknowledgement of the term red brick universities, used for an older generation of establishments).
