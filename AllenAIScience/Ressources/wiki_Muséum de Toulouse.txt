The Muséum de Toulouse, sometimes known as MHNT or Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle de la ville de Toulouse, is a museum of natural history in Toulouse, France. It is located in the Busca-Montplaisir, and houses a collection of more than 2.5 million items.


== HistoryEdit ==
The museum was founded in 1796 by the naturalist Philippe-Isidore Picot de Lapeyrouse. It was at that time housed in the old buildings of the monastery of the carmelite friars. It was opened to the public in 1865 in its present location and under the directorship of Édouard Filhol. Toulouse museum was the first museum in the world to open a gallery of prehistory, thanks to the collaboration of Émile Cartailhac, Jean-Baptiste Noulet and Eugène Trutat. Today the museum is housed in a 2007 building designed by the architect Jean-Paul Viguier.


== Permanent exhibitionsEdit ==
The permanent exhibition has 5 linked themes:

Sequence 2: Doing away with our notions of hierarchy
The nature of life - biodiversity, classification and organization.
Sequence 3: Getting to grips with the huge scale.
Earth history from 3.8 billion years ago. Introduces time, palaeontology and the evolution of life
Sequence 4: Admitting the obvious
The main functions of living beings - feeding, respiration, locomotion, reproduction, protection and communication.
Sequence 5: Inventing the future.
The impact of human activity- demographic pressure on ecosystems and natural resources

It contains his personal collections, supplemented by those of other ornithologists notably Georges Guichard, Henri Heim de Balsac and Rene de Naurois. It includes all the palearctic species (Europe, North Africa and Asia), that is to say approximately 1,000 species and nearly 15,000 eggs and is one of the most complete and best documented palearctic egg collections in Europe.

The botanic garden which honours his name is attached to the Museum and is part of the Earth and Life Science Research and Training Paul Sabatier University. A second botanical area The Museum Gardens extends over 3 hectares.
