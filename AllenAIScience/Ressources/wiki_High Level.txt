High Level is a town in northern Alberta, Canada. It is located at the intersection of the Mackenzie Highway (Highway 35) and Highway 58, approximately 733 kilometres (455 mi) north of Edmonton and 725 kilometres (450 mi) south of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. It is located within Mackenzie County and was founded in 1947.


== History ==
The name High Level originated from the height of the land that separates the Peace River and the Hay River. The original location was about 3.5 miles north of present spot and along the old Fort Vermilion/Meander River freighting trail, serving as a stopping place, not a town. The original High Level Sports Grounds were at this location and the old trail was still visible there in the mid-1960s. The High Level Golf & Country Club currently occupies this approximate location. For many years, High Level was known as Tloc Moi (Hay Meadow). The first fur traders arrived to this area in 1786, but it was not until 1947 that High Level was settled, with development of road access to Fort Vermilion being the primary factor in determining the Town's present location. High Level's first power plant was established in 1957, and a year later the first post office was built. The oil fields were discovered in the 1960s, and a railway was run to the area in 1963.


== Geography ==
High Level marks the northern extent of the Peace River Country, and has one of the northernmost lands suited for agriculture in Canada. It is surrounded to the north and west by muskeg tundra.


=== Climate ===
High Level has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc), with precipitation falling chiefly during the spring and summer, and wide temperature variations. The hottest recorded temperature 35.2 °C (95.4 °F) was on August 9, 1985, with the coldest recorded temperature -50.6 °C (-59.1 °F) on January 13, 1972. The name notwithstanding, this town lies at a low elevation for an Alberta community and the regional topography contributes to the extremes of temperature. In winter, very cold air often pools over the area. In summer, air masses originating from higher elevations warm by compression as they descend to High Level.


=== Wildlife ===
High Level has a variety of wildlife, including wolves, coyotes, ravens, and many types of insects. Hunters can find moose, deer, bear and geese. There are over 150 species of birds known to nest in the area.
