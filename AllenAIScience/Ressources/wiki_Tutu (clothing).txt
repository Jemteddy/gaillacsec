A tutu is a skirt worn as a costume in a ballet performance, often with attached bodice. It consists of a basque (or waistband, as it can either be part of the bodice or a separate band) made of tulle (hence the name "tutu" in French), and the skirt itself might be single layer of tulle, hanging down, or multiple layers starched and jutting out.
