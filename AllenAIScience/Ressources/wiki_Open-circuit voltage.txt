Open-circuit voltage (abbreviated as OCV or VOC ) is the difference of electrical potential between two terminals of a device when disconnected from any circuit. There is no external load connected. No external electric current flows between the terminals. It is sometimes given the symbol Voc. In network analysis this voltage is also known as the Thévenin voltage.
The open-circuit voltages of batteries and solar cells are often quoted under particular conditions (state-of-charge, illumination, temperature, etc.).
Open Circuit Potential is important since the metal with the low open potential will dissolve faster in the electrolyte than the metal with high open circuit potential. Pozdro EŹE
The potential difference mentioned in the batteries and cells is usually the open circuit voltage. Open circuit voltage is known as the emf , which is the maximum potential difference when there is no current and the circuit is not closed.
