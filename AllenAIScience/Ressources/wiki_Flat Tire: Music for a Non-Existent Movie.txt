Flat Tire: Music for a Non-Existent Movie is the eleventh studio album by guitarist Allan Holdsworth, released on 1 December 2001 through Megazoidal Records and reissued on 16 August 2007 through Eidolon Efformation. Besides the first track, the entire album was recorded by Holdsworth himself using the SynthAxe, an instrument for which Holdsworth has become well known since Atavachron (1986).


== Critical reception ==
Flat Tire has received mixed reviews. The staff at All About Jazz gave the album a positive review, calling it a "very uniquely rewarding listening experience" and going into detail about the quirks of the SynthAxe. However, they suggested that diehard fans of Holdsworth's work would appreciate it more than "devoted guitarheads". David R. Adler at AllMusic gave the album three stars out of five, describing the music as "more of a one-man band effect than a solo guitar performance" and "a bit static and repetitive overall". He called the album "not the best introduction" to first-time listeners of Holdsworth, but recommended it for fans of his work.
