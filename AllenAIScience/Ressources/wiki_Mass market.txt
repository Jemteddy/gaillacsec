The mass market is the largest group of end consumers for a specified product. It is the opposite of the term niche market.


== General ==
The mass market is the group of end consumers who occupy the overwhelming mass of a bell curve for common household products, i.e., they could be tagged as being "average". Yet, this group consists of such a wide variety of people, their desires towards a certain product may be totally different from each other. Often competition to supply the large market is fierce but relatively easy to enter because of the mass amount of consumer park available.
Although similar sounding, the mass market is the most unwieldy to harness by mass marketing because of the sheer number of consumers and the myriad of needs. It is difficult to target each and every customer in the mass market, therefore, marketers must divide the market into smaller groups with similar wants.
