The Carrera Autopodistica is an annual human-powered land vehicle racing competition that takes place in September in Castel San Pietro Terme near Bologna, Italy. The vehicles involved are unique, soapbox-like cars driven by a pilot and propelled by "spingitori", or pushing mens.


== History ==
The race is the central happening of Settembre Castellano, a series of cultural, sports, and gastronomic events, which have their climax every year on the second Sunday of September with the Sagra Castellana della Braciola (the sheep chop fair), which has been running since 1951. The Carrera Autopodistica has been running since 1953.
Over the last half-century, technological and sporting innovations have improved race performances. We went from the wood or iron made cars made in the '50s, to the carbon fiber and titanium cars we have nowadays. Teams work the whole year to build sophisticated cars, improving smoothness on downhill roads and flat ground, and decreasing vehicle weight for helping the athletes with less weight to push.


== Races ==
There are two competitions every year, held in the same day. The Coppa Terme, spanning a distance of 1,600 metres, starts at the beginning of Viale delle Terme and ends at the entrance of the spa building. The Carrera Autopodistica is the main event, taking place in the historical town center. Start and finish line is located in Piazza XX Settembre. The race consist in two laps of the urban track, each one is 1,250 meters.


== Rules ==
Four pushing mens ("spingitori") and a pilot take part in the races. The pushing mens swap running and pushing the car, like in a relay race, where the baton is the car. The competition rules allow only one person to push the car at a time. On the downhill part of the track ("la bassa"), where the car increase its speed, the pusher jump in the car behind the driver and then resumes pushing when the car speed reduces.


== Programme ==
Every year the program traditionally schedules the time trials on the first Sunday of September, which decide the starting grid. On the second Sunday of September, the Coppa Terme and Carrera Autopodistica races take place.
