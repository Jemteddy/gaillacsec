Civil Aircraft Missile Protection System or CAMPS is an infrared countermeasure against infrared-homed anti-aircraft missiles, specifically designed to defend civilian aircraft flying under 15,000 feet (4,600 m) against MANPADS.
The system was developed by Saab Avitronics, Chemring Countermeasures and Naturelink Aviation.
The decoys use a pyrophoric substance that burns at a relatively low temperature, thereby avoiding any fire safety concerns associated with conventional pyrotechnic military flares, such as those used by a similar Israeli system. The onboard processor uses neural network pattern recognition algorithms to classify potential threats detected by its infrared sensors. The system was successfully demonstrated at the Overberg Test Range in March 2007.
