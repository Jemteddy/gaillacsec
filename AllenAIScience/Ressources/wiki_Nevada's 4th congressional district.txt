Nevada's 4th Congressional District is a new district that was created as a result of the 2010 Census. Located in the central portion of the state, it includes most of northern Clark County, part of Lyon County, and all of Esmeralda, Lincoln, Mineral, Nye and White Pine counties. Although the district appears rural, more than four-fifths of the district's population lives in Clark County, and it is a majority-minority district.
Democrat Steven Horsford won the election for this seat in the 2012 House elections. He was seated for the 113th Congress in 2013 as the district's first congressman.
