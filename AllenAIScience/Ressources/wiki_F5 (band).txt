F5 is a heavy metal band based out of Phoenix, Arizona which features Megadeth bassist Dave Ellefson and ex-Megadeth drummer Jimmy DeGrasso.


== HistoryEdit ==


=== FormationEdit ===
Before F5 was formed, Dave Ellefson was the bassist for the multi-platinum thrash metal band Megadeth but in 2002 the band dissolved due to an injury to frontman Dave Mustaine's arm. Ellefson went on to produce one local band called Lifted, which is where he met guitarist Steve Conley and drummer Dave Small. After recruiting guitarist John Davis and vocalist Dale Steele, F5 was then formed.
F5 quickly realized their mission was to be heavy, but always melodic. With the creative flood gates wide open the group eagerly wrote scores of new songs and recorded their debut album A Drug For All Seasons with producer Ryan Greene, who is recognized for working with bands like Megadeth, Bad Religion, and NOFX. The record was released worldwide in 2005 on JVC (Japan/Asia), Mascot (Europe) and Cleopatra Records (North America).


==== The Debut AlbumEdit ====
In 2005, F5 released their debut album entitled A Drug For All Seasons. F5 toured in support of the album, including opening for Staind for one tour date on the Jägermeister Music Tour in 2006. MTV premiered the music video of F5's song Dissidence. The song Dissidence is included on a compilation CD called Unleashed 3.
In March 2013 the album was re-issued exclusively on iTunes with a new bonus track 'Sleeping Giants'.


==== The ReckoningEdit ====
In 2008, F5 released their second studio album entitled The Reckoning, with Ellefson's former Megadeth band-mate Jimmy DeGrasso joining on drums after Small left in 2007, and Ryan Greene again producing. The album was released via OarFin Distribution (Koch), licensed to Nightmare Records in North America and Silverwolf Productions in Europe.
A video emerged for the album's title track The Reckoning, followed by one for an unreleased non-album cover of Fight's Nailed To The Gun.


==== After F5Edit ====
In early 2010, Megadeth's official website announced the return of Dave Ellefson, leaving the future of F5 unknown. The previous year Jimmy DeGrasso had also returned to Alice Cooper's band, and as of May 2013 Steve Conley has joined Flotsam And Jetsam.
