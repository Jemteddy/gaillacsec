2 is the second full-length album by the Austrian singer-songwriter Luise Gruber, better known as Saint Lu. The album is noteworthy for its music direction change, from the blues and rock of its predecessor toward a more soul-oriented aesthetic with elements of funk, jazz and baroque pop. The album was released on 15 February 2013 via Warner Music. The album was intended to accompany Saint Lu's representation of Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmö but the selection jury in Hannover selected Cascada instead.
