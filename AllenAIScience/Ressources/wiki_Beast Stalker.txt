Unable to handle the guilt, Tong Fei succumbs to a fog of pain. Gao Min, meanwhile, pours all her love and attention to her younger daughter Ling.

== ReceptionEdit ==
Derek Elley of Variety wrote, "Crying out for a Stateside remake from its opening reel, stygian crimer Beast Stalker grips like a vise, and is unquestionably the finest Asian action-psychodrama since South Korea's The Chaser last year." Neil Young of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, "This glossy, flashily directed plausibility-stretcher picks up whenever the bad guy's unusual character and history are being explored, but flattens out when the focus shifts back from pursued to pursuer." G. Allen Johnson of the San Francisco Chronicle called it a new addition to "Hong Kong's great cycle of kinetic action films".
