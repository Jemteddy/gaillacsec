The standard Gibbs free energy of formation of a compound is the change of Gibbs free energy that accompanies the formation of 1 mole of a substance in its standard state from its constituent elements in their standard states (the most stable form of the element at 1 bar of pressure and the specified temperature, usually 298.15 K or 25 Â°C).
This table includes several Standard Gibbs function of formation evaluated at 298 K. Note that all values are in kJ/mol.
