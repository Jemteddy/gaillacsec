The Viktorshöhe is a hill, 585 metres high, in the Harz mountains of central Germany. It lies on the Ramberg massif, about 3 kilometres northeast of Friedrichsbrunn.


== History ==
Even before 1900 there was a privately owned inn and observation platform on the summit that had become a popular destination for day trippers. At the end of the 1970s the building complex became a company-owned holiday home for the Draht- und Seilwerke Rothenburg (Rothenburg Wire and Cable Company). The next-door restaurant was a favourite walking and excursion halt. Points of interest were the wooden observation tower, which has now become very dilapidated and is no longer accessible. The buildings on the Viktorshöhe became empty during the 1990s and are gradually falling into ruin. The remaining furniture lies scattered about the area and gives an impression of destruction and neglect, reminiscent of war.


== Surrounding area ==
In the vicinity of the Viktorshöhe there are several tourist attractions: the Große Teufelsmühle, the Bergrat Müller Teich (Teich = pond), the Bear Monument, the ruined castle of Erichsberg, the Bremer Teich campsite and the Erichburger Teich.
