79 Ceti (also known as HD 16141) is a yellow subgiant star approximately 127 light-years away in the constellation Cetus. It has stopped hydrogen fusion in its core, this implies an age much higher than our Sun's 4.5 billion years. Eventually the outer layers of the star will expand and cool and the star will become a red giant. Currently 79 Ceti has a luminosity twice that of the Sun.
