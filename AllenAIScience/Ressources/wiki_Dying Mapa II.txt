Dying Mapa II is an album by the Japanese noise band Merzbow, then consisting of Masami Akita and Kiyoshi Mizutani. This is the second installment of the Dying Mapa trilogy inspired by the Nyingmapa school of Tibetan Buddhism.
Musically, the whole trilogy is made with different equipment and instruments than other recordings of the same period. It also features instruments recorded on tape and then either slowed down or played backwards.
This album was later included on the 50-CD box set Merzbox split between CD 15 (with Dying Mapa I) and CD 16 (with Dying Mapa III).
