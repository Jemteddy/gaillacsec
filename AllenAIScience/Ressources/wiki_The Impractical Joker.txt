The Impractical Joker is a 1937 Fleischer Studios animated short film starring Betty Boop.


== Synopsis ==
Betty Boop is baking a cake, when Irving the practical joker comes for a visit. Betty becomes the victim of such pranks as shaking a false hand and getting squirted in the face. Betty calls on Grampy for help and he quickly rigs his apartment to counteract Irving's pranks and send him on his way. Irving gets the last laugh, when Grampy lights the candle on the cake. Irving replaced the candle with a firecracker before he left.
Pinto Colvig (the voice of Goofy) provides the voice for Irving.
