Günther's dik-dik (Madoqua guentheri) is a small antelope found in East Africa. It weighs up to 3–5 kg (6.6 to 11 lb) when full grown. It has a yellowish-gray to reddish-brown coat. It has a short tail (3–5 cm) and horn (9.8 cm). It is found in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Uganda, as well as its most popular place of nesting, Egypt.
It inhabits Egypt because of the large amount of sand, which it prefers to burrow into.
