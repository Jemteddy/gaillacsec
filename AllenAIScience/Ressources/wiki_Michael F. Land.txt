Michael Francis Land FRS (born 12 April 1942) is a British neurobiologist. He is currently Emeritus Professor of Neurobiology in the Sussex Vision laboratory at the Sussex Centre for Neuroscience, University of Sussex, England.
Land's research has been on different aspects of animal and human vision. His interests were in the optics of the eyes of marine animals, including scallops, shrimps and deep-water crustaceans. He also studied visual behaviour in spiders and insects, particularly during pursuit. This led to an interest in eye movement in animals and later in man.
Land's group in Sussex is now mainly concerned with the role of eye movement in human activities such as driving, music reading and ball games. In 2000 for example Land and a colleague reported their finding that in cricket, within 200 milliseconds after a ball leaves a bowler's hand, the best batsmen will take their eyes off the ball and look ahead to the point where they have calculated it will bounce (see also Land & McLeod (2000) in bibliography).
Other work is on the processing of visual information by the retinas of mosquitoes.


== Education ==
The son of Professor Frank William Land, from 1950 to 1960 Land attended Birkenhead School, a direct grant school, on the Wirral in Cheshire. From here he went to the University of Cambridge where he studied Zoology, graduating in 1963. A PhD in Neurophysiology at University College London (UCL) followed, completed in 1968. It was at UCL that Land began his research into human and animal vision.


== Academic career ==
After completing his PhD at UCL, where he had been an assistant lecturer in Physiology, in 1969 Land became assistant professor of Physiology at University of California, Berkeley. He returned to the UK in 1971, taking up a post as Lecturer in Neurobiology at the University of Sussex. Here he was appointed Reader in 1977. After being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1982 he was appointed Professor in 1984. He was also a Senior Visiting Fellow at the Australian National University, Canberra from 1982 to 1984. In 1994 he received the Frink Medal of the Zoological Society of London, and in 1996 the Alcon Prize for vision research. Land retired from full-time academic work in 2005 and is now Emeritus Professor of Neurobiology at Sussex.
