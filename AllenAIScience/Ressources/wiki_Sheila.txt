Sheila (alternatively spelled Shelagh and Sheelagh) is a common given name for a female, derived from the Irish name Síle/Sìle, which is believed to be a Gaelic form of Cecilia. Like "Cecil" or "Cecilia", the name means "blind", from the Latin word caecus.
It is also encountered as an alternative spelling of the unrelated Indian girl's name Sheela, which is of Sanskrit origin.
