A sponge is a tool or cleaning aid consisting of porous material. Sponges are usually used for cleaning impervious surfaces. They are especially good at absorbing water and water-based solutions.
Sponges are commonly made from cellulose wood fibers or foamed plastic polymers. Some natural sponges are still sold, but most are now used either as body or facial sponges (bath sponges) or as tools for sponge painting.
The three other categories of widely available synthetic sponges are low-density polyether (known as the rainbow packs of non-absorbent sponges), PVA (a highly absorbent material), and polyester.
Polyester sponges are subdivided into a variety of types, some of which are reticulated (artificially broken-in) for ease of use. One type, double-blown polyester, has high water-retention ability approaching or equaling that of PVA sponges, but with visible pores and more diverse uses.

Because it is primarily made of wood fiber, a cellulose sponge can be a medium for the growth of harmful bacteria or fungi, especially when it is allowed to remain wet between uses.


== Cleaning sponges ==
Several methods have been used to clean sponges. Studies have investigated the use of the microwave to clean non-metallic domestic sponges which have been thoroughly wetted. A 2006 study found that microwaving wet sponges for two minutes (at 1000 watt power) removed 99% of coliforms, E. coli and MS2 phages, but Bacillus cereus spores were killed at 4 minutes of microwaving. After some fires were caused by people trying to replicate the results at home, the study's author urged people to make sure their sponges were wet. A 2009 study showed that the microwave and the dishwasher were both effective ways to clean domestic sponges.
