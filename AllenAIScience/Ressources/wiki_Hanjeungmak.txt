Hanjeungmak (한증막; 汗蒸幕) is Korean traditional sauna. Intensely hot and dry, it uses traditionally burning wood of pine to heat a domelike kiln made of stone.


== History ==
The first mention of hanjeungmak, initially referred to as Hanjeungso(한증소; 汗蒸所), is found in the Annals of Sejong in the 15th century. The record also state that the Korean kiln saunas were used for medicinal purposes. At that time, hanjeungmaks were state-supported kiln saunas maintained by Buddhist monks. Since 1429, the saunas were constructed separating facilities for men and women. There are a picture painted by Kim Jun geun in the 19th century depicting a hanjeungmak and its circular wall made from bricks accompanied by a bath house.


== Trends ==
Nowadays, hanjeungmaks are incorporated into Korean-style spa, jjimjilbang rather than an independent facility. Bulgama installed in jjimjilbang is a variety of hanjeungmak, heated with higher temperature. Sometimes the dome-shaped walls of kiln rooms are plastered with loam, salt, minerals.
