Miles! Miles! Miles! is an album by Miles Davis, released exclusively in Japan in 1993. It contains recordings from the October 4, 1981 concert in Tokyo, some of which had appeared on We Want Miles, including the original version of the track "Jean-Pierre", elsewhere edited by producer Teo Macero to remove the first twenty-five seconds of introduction, consisting primarily of a guitar riff and tumbling percussion sounds.
