Steens Mountain Running Camp is a nationally known running camp.
Founded in 1975, it was designed to give campers aged 13â€“19 a realistic wilderness running and camping experience. Located in Southeastern Oregon, 60 miles southwest of Burns on the Steens Mountain range that rises to 9,773 feet (2,979 m), Steens Mountain Running Camp provides high school runners from around the country with the opportunity to experience high altitude conditioning.In addition to cardiovascular and muscular training, participants experience instruction in all areas of distance training and racing, with emphasis on performance and improvement through motivational and self-image enhancement strategies. To enhance personal growth, participants must be willing to adapt to lack of urban conveniences lacking in the Steens Mountain Wilderness area. Steens Mountain Running Camp offers a number of distance running-related activities over a five-day period including a 30 mile hike/run, a cross canyon race, an uphill 5 kilometer race, and many other distance runs, based on participants ability level. Camp counselors consist of college and professional runners from around the United States. In January 2003, the Bureau of Land Management approved the continuation of the commercial Steens Mountain Running Camp within the Steens Mountains wilderness area.
