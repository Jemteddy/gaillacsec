The formation of igneous rocks from magma is known as magmatism.
Magmatism is a process responsible for mountain formation. The process of magmatism produces an additional mass and volume to the Earthâ€™s surface. For example, the formation of volcanoes or island arcs at convergent plate boundaries or mid-ocean ridges and therefore sea-floor spreading at divergent plate boundaries.
Magmas form by partial melting of silicate rocks either in Earth's mantle, continental or oceanic crust.
