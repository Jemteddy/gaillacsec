Genetic engineering is a contentious issue in New Zealand. The possibility that GE crops may be grown in New Zealand led to a nationwide protest movement including marches in the main centres.
In 2000 the Government appointed a Royal Commission to report on issues relating to genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The Report of the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification, released in July 2001, concluded that New Zealand should keep its options open with regard to genetic engineering and to proceed carefully in order to minimise and manage any risks.
Prior to the 2002 general election, the book Seeds of Distrust was published which highlighted possible contamination of imported corn seed with GMO seeds. During the election campaign the book caused an amount of friction between the Labour and Green Parties, referred to as "Corngate" in the media.


== Field trials ==
Field trials of genetically engineered Pinus radiata trees is being carried out by SCION, a Crown Research Institute. Environmental activists breached the security at the site and damaged 19 of the trees in 2008. No organisation claimed responsibility but a spade left on the site had a "GE-free New Zealand" sticker attached to it. The Soil & Health Association alerted the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA) of breach of conditions stipulated for growing the trees.
Brassica species have been approved by ERMA for a ten-year field trial in Canterbury. The conditions that were set for the trial were breached and lobbyists called for an end to the trial due to concerns for safety to the public and for maintaining an export market that was free of GE contamination.
