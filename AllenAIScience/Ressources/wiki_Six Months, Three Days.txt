"Six Months, Three Days" is an award-winning science fiction novelette by Charlie Jane Anders. It was originally published on Tor.com in 2011, and was subsequently reprinted in Some of the Best from Tor.com: 2011 Edition and Year's Best SF 17.


== Plot ==
Doug and Judy are both precognitive: Doug can see "the future", and Judy can see "many possible futures". They fall in love, even though they both know that their relationship will last exactly six months and three days, and end very badly.


== Reception ==
The story was nominated for the 2011 Nebula Award and the 2011 Theodore Sturgeon Award, and won the Hugo Award for Best Novelette.
Rachel Swirsky describes the story as a "philosophical contrast" between determinism and free will.
In 2013, Deadline.com announced that a television adaptation was being prepared for NBC, with script written by Eric Garcia.
