== Awards and honours ==
In 2008 Hibberd was named by Nature as one of "Five crop researchers who could change the world" for his research that is attempting to replace C3 carbon fixation in rice with C4 carbon fixation. This would greatly increase the efficiency of photosynthesis and create a rice cultivar which could "have 50% more yield" which "would impact billions of people". His research is part funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
