All of Frictional's titles employ the in-house game engine HPL. The company's first commercially released video game was the survival horror game Penumbra: Overture in 2007. It is based on Frictional Games' earlier game Penumbra, a short tech demo meant to demonstrate the capabilities of the company's engine. Overture was followed by its sequel Penumbra: Black Plague in 2008 which in turn was followed by the expansion Penumbra: Requiem later in 2008. In 2010, Frictional Games released their fourth game Amnesia: The Dark Descent which introduced version 2 of the HPL Engine. They have acted as executive producers and publishers on an indirect sequel to The Dark Descent titled Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, developed by The Chinese Room and released in 2013.
Frictional Games has recently released Soma, which is powered by the HPL Engine 3.
