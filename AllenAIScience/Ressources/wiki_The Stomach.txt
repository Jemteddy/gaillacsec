== Synopsis ==
Frank (Simon Meacock) is a spirit medium whose talents have proven to be more of a curse than a gift. Whenever a spirit is present his stomach will swell and pulsate, a process that enables his customers to talk to their dead loved ones but at the cost of his own physical well being. Tired of the constant pain and suffering, Frank decides that he will give up the medium life but finds that one of his customers is unwilling to accept his new decision to change his career.
