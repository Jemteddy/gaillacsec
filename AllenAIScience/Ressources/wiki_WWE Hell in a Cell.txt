WWE Hell in a Cell is a professional wrestling event produced annually by WWE, a Connecticutâ€“based professional wrestling promotion, and broadcast live and available only through pay-per-view (PPV) and the WWE Network. The event was established in 2009, replacing WWE No Mercy in the early October slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar. In 2012, WWE announced that Hell in a Cell will be moving to late October, leaving only one pay-per-view in October. However, in 2013 WWE added Battleground (originally as Over the Limit) in an early October slot. The 2014 edition of Hell in a Cell had an attendance of 15,333.
The concept of the show comes from WWE's established Hell in a Cell match, in which competitors fight inside a 20-foot-high roofed cell structure surrounding the ring and ringside area. Each main event match of the card is contested under the Hell in a Cell stipulation. Hell in a Cell was chosen over No Escape, Locked Up and Rage in a Cage.
Since its origin, the event has been held only in indoor arenas in the United States. Championship bouts are scheduled on every card, with the lower-tier titles contested on the undercard and the top-tier appearing on the main card. Under the Brand Extension, WWE assigned its performers to either Raw or SmackDown, which cause matches to be set up between wrestlers on the same show.


== Concept ==
The concept of this pay-per-view is that all the main event matches would be fought inside a 24-foot-high roofed cell structure surrounding the ring and ringside area. In a Hell in a Cell match, there are no disqualifications or count-outs (also no escape). The only way to win is by pinfall or submission inside the ring.
Two variations of the match have happened, though neither of them are considered Hell in a Cell matches by WWE. The first was Kane winning the WWE Championship from Stone Cold Steve Austin in a First Blood match at King of the Ring inside a Hell in a Cell-like cage; the match was not intended to take place inside the cell but the edifice was lowered over the ring as the match progressed. The second saw Big Boss Man challenging Al Snow for the WWE Hardcore Championship in a Kennel from Hell match at Unforgiven. The match consisted of a standard steel cage with the cell placed atop it, and the object was to escape from both the cage and cell while trying to avoid guard dogs that were placed between the ring and cell door. Snow, the first competitor to escape the steel cage and the cell, was declared the winner.
