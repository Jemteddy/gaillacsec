Carbohydrate dehydrogenases are a group of dehydrogenase enzymes that occur in many organisms and facilitate the conversion from a carbohydrate to an aldehyde, lactone, or ketose.
An example includes L-gulonolactone oxidase.
They are categorized under EC number 1.1. More specifically, they are in three subcodes: 1, 2, and 99, categorized as follows:
EC 1.1.1 With NAD or NADP as acceptor
EC 1.1.2 With a cytochrome as acceptor
EC 1.1.99 With other acceptors
