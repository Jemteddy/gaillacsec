Congenital hemolytic anemia (or hereditary hemolytic anemia) refers to hemolytic anemia which is primarily due to congenital disorders.


== Types ==
Basically classified by causative mechanism, types of congenital hemolytic anemia include:
Genetic conditions of RBC Membrane
Hereditary spherocytosis
Hereditary elliptocytosis

Genetic conditions of RBC metabolism (enzyme defects). This group is sometimes called congenital nonspherocytic (hemolytic) anemia, which is a term for a congenital hemolytic anemia without spherocytosis, and usually excluding hemoglobin abdormalities as well, but rather encompassing defects of glycolysis in the erythrocyte.Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD or favism)
Pyruvate kinase deficiency
Aldolase A deficiency

Hemoglobinopathies/genetic conditions of hemoglobin
Sickle cell anemia
Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia
Thalassemia
