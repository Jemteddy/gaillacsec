Visual geography is the study of geography as represented in paintings, photos and other forms of the visual arts. Both human geography and physical geography in the visual arts are studied. Typical studies in Visual Geography include the geographical symbols within visual arts. Another is cross referencing the date a piece of visual art was produced with known weather records to see if the art was drawn accurately in the field or from memory in a studio.
