The yellow bumblebee, or golden northern bumblebee (Bombus fervidus), is a species of bumblebee native to North America. It has a yellow-colored abdomen and thorax. Its range includes the North American continent, excluding much of Texas, Alaska, and the northern parts of Canada. It is common in cities and farmland. It is similar in colour and range to the American bumblebee (Bombus pensylvanicus). It has complex behavioral traits, which include a communication system that involves dancing and a coordinated nest defense to ward off predators. B. fervidus is an important ecosystem pollinator, but populations are currently declining in number.


== Taxonomy and Phylogeny ==
Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius first identified Bombus fervidus, also known as the yellow bumblebee or golden northern bumblebee, in 1798. B. fervidus is a member of the order Hymenoptera, which is comprised of wasps, ants, bees, and sawflies. It is in the Bombus genus, which is the Latin word for “buzzing.” This genus comprises most bumblebees, which are social bees that can sting more than once. It is also of the Apidae family, which is a diverse family of bees including honeybees, orchid bees, bumble bees, stingless bees, cuckoo bees and carpenter bees.


== Description and Identification ==
B. fervidus is 13-16 mm long. The first four abdominal tergites are yellow. The occiput and face are black, and have yellow pleurae extending to or nearly to the bases of the legs. A black strip runs along the abdomen between the wings. The wings are dark to dark grey colored. The rest of the body is yellow, giving it the common name golden bumblebee. The hairs are thick. B. fervidus is long-tongued and therefore specialize on flowers with long corollas. Males have slightly more yellow on their abdomen that fades into the thorax. Males have a wingspan of 22 mm white female workers have a wingspan of 40 mm.


== Distribution and habitat ==
B. fervidus is commonly found in northern New England.Populations can also found throughout northern portions of Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina, as well as the northern part of the United States. Its nests are not easily found, and are often formed inside the open space of abandoned beehives.


=== Nest ===
The nest of B. fervidus is a loose mass of soft, lightly entangled grass mixed with goose-feces that are most likely carried in and arranged by the bees themselves. B. fervidus generally nest in grassy, open areas, which includes forests and along roadsides. Nests can be located both above and below ground, but the latter is more common. Nests are typically within 50 meters of a food source that can feed the entire colony.


== Colony Cycle ==
B. fervidus queens lay eggs individually in cells within the nest. When these eggs hatch, the larvae emerge and feed on honey for growth. The queen makes the honey for the larva until they are ready to pupate, which is when the larva create cocoons for themselves where they stay to metamorphose into adults. Metamorphosis typically takes 16 to 25 days. Once the adults bees emerge from the cocoon, they are adult workers. This first generation of the brood that becomes workers are responsible for feeding the next generation of developing larvae and the queen. This ensures that the queen can focus on laying more eggs. Thus, each generation of B. fervidus is larger than the one before it.


=== Nest Population ===
A typical nest contains four eggs, fifteen larvae, forty-two pupae and seventeen adults. Ten of the adults are worker adults, containing small undeveloped ovaries with no eggs, while the remaining adults are males with mature sperm. The pupae are 37 males, 5 future workers and only one queen. The larvae fall into three groups – large (nearly full grown), small or indeterminate. Workers typically live on average for 34.1 days.


== Breeding and Lifespan ==
Male bumblebees, also known as drones, have a purely reproductive purpose. In the fall, males and newly hatched queens mate until the weather cools. At this time, young queens hibernate underground until the spring. The queens then emerge from hibernation and feed on pollen and nectar until they can lay their first brood of 8 to 10 eggs. Before laying the eggs, they build a nest out of grass and deposit honey into a wax honey pot. Breeding occurs in the summer months. Most workers live for a brief period of time due to the intensity of their work, while queens live for 12 months on average.


== Diet ==
Bombus fervidus is a nectarivore, meaning it mostly acquires nutrients from the sugar-rich nectar of flowering plants. This aids in the pollination of plants that they feed on. The long tongues of B. fervidus enables them to reach into long flowers, extracting the nectar before another competitor does. This suggests an evolutionary selective pressure for long tongues in B. fervidus. These bees are also very effective workers, and their quickness can sometimes be harmful to their health. B. fervidus sometimes work for so long at such a rapid pace that is normal for them that they die due to exhaustion. Additionally, adult bees chew pollen and mix it with their saliva to produce honey. This honey is then used to feed the larvae and the queen. The efficiency of B. fervidus lends to its ability to grow to very large populations.


== Behavior ==


=== Worker-Queen Conflict ===
B. fervidus workers are responsible for making the honey that the queen and developing brood eat. The workers chew pollen and mix it with their saliva to make the honey. Since they need ample pollen for honey, workers spend a lot of time foraging for nectar and pollen, simultaneously pollinating flowers. When a worker emerges from its cocoon, it will devote most of its time toward developing the brood and consequently building a larger nest out of grass to accommodate the growing colony. If the colony grows too big, then new queens are killed before it is time for them to mate. Males have a purely reproductive purpose in the nest.


=== Foraging ===
B. fervidus typically search for food in the afternoon, which is often the hottest part of the day. An individual can visit as many as forty-four flowers per minute, with each visit bringing 0.05 mg of sugar if another insect had not foraged at the site before. Therefore, B. fervidus can extract around 2.2 mg of sugar per minute. The bees' foraging behavior includes building stores or caches of foods such as nectar and pollen. These are used to feed and expand the colony.


=== Communication ===
B. fervidus, like many bee species, communicates mainly by dancing. These dances communicate information such as the location of food or as a warning of nearby danger. They also communicate via regurgitation, in which bees present nectar to each other and it is either accepted or rejected by the colony based on the needs of the colony.


=== Competition ===
As mentioned previously, B. fervidus use their long tongues to extract nectar and pollen from longer flowers, which is a morphological strategy employed to curb the effects of competition. 


== Ecology ==


=== Predation ===
B. fervidus use different means to protect themselves against predators. If an intruder enters the nest, then the bees cover the intruder with honey. If a bee has not developed enough to fly, and becomes slightly alarmed within the nest, it will lift up its middle legs. If the disturbance is elevated, the bee will lie on its back and place its legs and feet in a position that implies it is preparing itself for whatever may come next. The stinger is positioned in the air with the mandibles flaring. The mature adults will leave the nest to sting and bite the predator or attacker. Since bumblebees, unlike honeybees, do not lose their stingers or die after one sting, they can sting an attacker over and over again. This gives the bee a better chance of survival. B. fervidus are also known to defecate on an intruder or attacker.


==== Parasites ====
One very successful parasite of all Bombus species is Bombus bohemicus. It lives within the nest and eats the eggs of its host. Consequently, the host workers care for the brood of the parasite instead of their own. The earlier this parasite enters the host nest, the longer it will wait before laying its eggs. Eggs are laid during the growth phase of workers in their colony cycle. This results in a reduced number of workers reared in the nest. This replacement of host eggs with parasite eggs is a gradual process as a strategy in which there is an overlap between the colony investment of both species.


=== Ecosystem Roles ===
The greatest role of Bombus fervidus in the ecosystem is as a pollinator of many flowering plants. Thus, B. fervidus have a positive influence on humans as they help to pollinate many flowers including major plant crops harvested as food. One negative influence of B. fervidus on humans is that they sting humans immediately when they feel a threat as a defense mechanism.


=== Conservation status ===
Like most bumblebees, Bombus fervidus is in decline and in need of protection, but it is not currently a threatened or endangered species.
