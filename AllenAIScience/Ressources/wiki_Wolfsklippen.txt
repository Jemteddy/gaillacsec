The Wolfsklippen is a granite mountain, 723 m above NN high, in the Harz mountains in Central Germany with an observation platform on the summit. The mountain lies northeast of the Brocken, the highest elevation in the Harz, about 200 m east of the road way from Drei Annen Hohne to Plessenburg.


== History ==
Over 100 years ago the Harz Club erected on the summit of the Wolfsklippen one of four iron observation platforms in the Harz that still exist. At that time it had a good view of the Brocken and towards Ilsenburg and Wernigerode. Today this outlook is no longer visible due to the tall spruce trees that block the view.
The Wolfsklippen is check point no. 24 on the walking trail network known as the Harzer Wandernadel.
