The North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT) is a part of the government of the U.S. state of North Dakota. NDDOT oversees the state's transportation system. This includes planning both new construction and reconstruction projects on roads and highways throughout the state. NDDOT also is responsible for the issuance of state driver's licenses.
North Dakota, despite its small population, has the distinction of a transportation system that per capita has more miles of road than any other state in the United States, managed by the second smallest Department of Transportation within the country (second only to Hawaii). Despite the small size of the Department, North Dakota has more registered vehicles than there are residents of the state.
The Director is Grant Levi, and the central office is located on the North Dakota State Capitol grounds in Bismarck.
