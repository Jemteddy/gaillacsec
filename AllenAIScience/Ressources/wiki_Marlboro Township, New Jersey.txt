Marlboro Township is a township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the township had a population of 40,191, reflecting an increase of 5,449 (+16.3%) from the 33,423 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 6,707 (+25.1%) from the 26,716 counted in the 1990 Census.
Marlboro Township was formed by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 17, 1848, from portions of Freehold Township. The township was named for the marl beds found in the area.


== History ==


=== Historical timeline ===


==== Lenni Lenape ====
The Lenni Lenape Native Americans were the first known organized inhabitants of this area, having settled here about one thousand years ago and forming an agricultural society, occupying small villages that dotted what was to become Marlboro Township.
In 1600, the Delaware / Lenape Native American population in the surrounding area may have numbered as many as 20,000. Several wars, at least 14 separate epidemics (yellow fever, small pox, influenza, encephalitis lethargica, etc.) and disastrous over-harvesting of the animal populations reduced their population to around 4,000 by the year 1700. Since the Lenape people, like all Native Americans, had no immunity to European diseases, when the populations contacted the epidemics, they frequently proved fatal. Some Lenape starved to death as a result of animal over-harvesting, while others were forced to trade their land for goods such as clothing and food. They were eventually moved to reservations set up by the US Government. They were first moved to the only Indian Reservation in New Jersey, the Brotherton Reservation in Burlington County, New Jersey (1758-1802). Those who remained survived through attempting to adapt to the dominant culture, becoming farmers and tradesmen. As the Lenni Lenape population declined, and the European population increased, the history of the area was increasingly defined by the new European inhabitants and the Lenape Native American tribes played an increasingly secondary role.


==== Dutch arrival ====
After the Dutch arrival to the region in the 1620s, the Lenape were successful in restricting Dutch settlement to Pavonia in present-day Jersey City along the Hudson until the 1660s and the Swedish settlement to New Sweden (1655 - The Dutch defeat the Swedes on the Delaware). The Dutch finally established a garrison at Bergen, allowing settlement of areas within the province of New Netherland. Within a period of 112 years, 1497–1609, four European explorers claimed this land for their sponsors: John Cabot, 1497, for England; Giovanni de Verrazano, 1524, for France; Estevan Gomez, 1525, for Spain, Henry Hudson, 1609, for Holland. Then for 50 years, 1614–1664, the Monmouth County area came under the influence of the Dutch, but it was not settled until English rule in 1664.
The initial European proprietors of the area purchased the land from the Lenni Lenape leader or Sakamaker. The chief of the Unami, or Turtle clan, was traditionally the great chief of all the Lenni Lenape. One of the sons of the leader, was Weequehela who negotiated the sale of several of the initial tracts of land to the first farmers. An early deed refers to "the chief sachems or leaders of Toponemus." Their main village was near Wickatunk in Marlboro Township.
On April 2, 1664, the English appointed Richard Nicolls to serve as the Deputy Governor of New York and New Jersey. One year later, April 8, 1665, Nicolls issued "The Monmouth Patent" to twelve men who had come from Western Long Island and New England seeking permanent stability for religious and civil freedom as well as the prospect of improving their estates. Nicolls was unaware that in June, 1664, James had given a lease and release for New Jersey to Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, thus invalidating the grant to the Monmouth Patentees. The rule at the time was that land should be purchased from the Patent.
However, in the time between 1685 and the early 18th century, the patent was ignored and land was gradually purchased from the Lenni Lenape causing confusion and disputes over ownership. Following the initial sale of land, the history of the township starts about 1685, when the land was first settled by European farmers from Scotland, England and the Netherlands. The Scottish exiles and early Dutch settlers lived on isolated clearings carved out of the forest. The lingua franca or common language spoken in the area was likely, overwhelmingly Dutch. However, this was one of many languages spoken with the culture very steeped in New Netherlander. The official documentation at the time is frequently found to be in the Dutch language. The documents of the time also suggest that money transactions used the British shilling. The English and Scotch settlers were Quakers. After initial European contact, the Lenape population sharply declined.
The first settlers of the area were led by missionary George Keith. They were Quakers. The Quakers established a meetinghouse and a cemetery on what is now Topanemus Road and held the first meeting on October 10, 1702. The first leader of the church was Rev. George Keith who received a large grant of land in the area due to his position as Surveyor-General. Among the first listed communicants of the new church were Garret and Jan Schenck. The church later changed its affiliation to the Episcopal faith and became St. Peter's Episcopal Church which is now located in Freehold. The old burial ground still remains on Topanemus Road. In 1692 those of the Presbyterian Faith built a church and burial ground on what is now Gordons Corner Road. The church eventually moved to Tennent where it became known as the Old Tennent Church and played a role in the American Revolutionary War. The old Scots Cemetery still remains at its original site.


==== Marl's discovery ====
The township of Marlboro is named for the prevalence of marl, which was first discovered in the area east of the village in 1768. The "Marl Pits" are clearly reflected on maps from 1889 shown as a dirt road off of Hudson Street heading towards the current location of the township soccer fields. Farmers used marl to improve the soil in the days before commercial fertilizers and there was a heavy demand for it. Marlboro Township's first industry was the export of the material, used primarily as fertilizer. In 1853, the Marl was harvested and transported to other parts of the state and to the Keyport docks via the Freehold Marl Company Railroad (now the Henry Hudson Trail). The marl was then sent to New York and other parts of the country via ship. Prior to the finding of Marl, the area was known as 'Bucktown' for John Buck who owned a tavern in the area.


==== Revolutionary War ====
Marlboro Township was the scene of a number of skirmishes during the American Revolutionary War, in particular following the Battle of Monmouth in 1778. During the war, the Pleasant Valley section was often raided by the British for food supplies and livestock. The area was referred to as the "Hornet's Nest" because of the intensity of attacks on the British by local militia. Beacon Hill (of present-day Beacon Hill Road) was one of three Monmouth County sites where beacons were placed to warn the residents and the Continental forces if the enemy should approach from the bay. There was also considerable activity in the Montrose area of the Township as British troops, retreating from the Battle of Monmouth, tried to wind their way to ships lying off Sandy Hook.


==== Township formation ====

Under the direction and influence of John W. Herbert, Marlboro was established as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 17, 1848, formed from portions of Freehold Township. The township's name was originally "Marlborough," but was subsequently changed to "Marlboro." It is unknown when the name was officially changed, with maps and other documents in the decades after the township's establishment referring variously to "Marlboro" or "Marlborough". The first elected freeholder was John W. Herbert.
Marlboro was rural and composed mostly of dairy farms, potato, tomato and other farms laced with small hamlets with modest inns or taverns. Before World War II Marlboro Township was actually the nation's largest grower of potatoes and also known for a large tomato and egg industry. During World War II, egg farms significantly expanded to accommodate military demand.
Following World War II, the state began to significantly build and improve the area transportation infrastructure. As the infrastructure improved, the population started to increase. The 50s and 60s saw Marlboro starting to significantly grow. Housing developments started to replace the farm and rural nature as the community expanded. After the early 1970s, Marlboro became a growing suburb for people working in New York and in large nearby corporations. During the 1980s and early 1990s most of the new housing developments featured four- or five-bedroom houses, but later the trend shifted toward larger estate homes. The building effort became so advanced that Marlboro Township placed restrictions for building around wetlands; called the Stream Corridor Preservation Restrictions to mitigate construction and habitat contamination.
The year 2000 saw continued growth of the housing trend toward larger homes. Towards the end of the decade, housing growth declined due to the Great Recession.


=== Historical events ===


==== Town center ====
The Marlboro township center has historically been considered an area around the intersection of Main Street (Route 79) and School Road. In the late 19th century the intersection held a hotel [currently fire department parking lot], general store [was on the lot of the current fire department building], and Post Office [was on the lot of a current Chinese Restaurant]. Behind the current small mini-mart on the corner of this intersection, you can still see one of the original barns from the early 19th century. The township of Marlboro has erected signs in front of historically significant buildings to explain their historical significant status. Multiple signs can be seen along Main Street and on some other streets in the town center area. However, Marlboro no longer has any official town center and can be considered an example of suburban sprawl. Efforts are underway to create an official "Village Center" and multiple proposals have come forward in recent discussions. Current vision statements suggest the creation of a pedestrian-friendly, mixed use Village Center, with an emphasis on walkability and traffic calming.


==== Cell phone ban ====
In 2000, Marlboro became the first municipality in New Jersey, and one of the first areas in the U.S., to ban cell phone use while driving, a ban that took effect in March 2001. The restriction established made use of a cell phone a primary offense, allowing a police officer can stop a motorist for phone use.


==== Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital ====
Opened in 1931, Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital was located on 400 acres (1.6 km2) in the eastern part of the township. It was opened with much fanfare as a "state of the art" psychiatric facility. It was closed 67 years later on June 30, 1998, as part of a three-year deinstitutionalization plan in which some the state's largest facilities were being shut down, with Marlboro's 800 patients being shifted to smaller facilities and group homes. The land that the hospital was placed on was known as the "Big Woods Settlement". It was largely farm land but there was a large distillery on the property which was torn down to make room for the hospital. Additionally, due to the long residential stays at the hospital, a cemetery was also located near the hospital for the residents who died while in residence and were unclaimed. There is currently a large fence around the hospital and the hospital is currently in the process of being demolished with expected completion by 2015. Most of the land was carved out for a Monmouth County Park system park, some of the ground was granted to the YMCA, and some of the ground will be the final linkage of the Henry Hudson Trail.


==== 40% Green ====
In June 2009, Marlboro Township Municipal Utilities Authority (MTMUA) deployed a 900 kW solar power array from Sharp that will enable the MTMUA to meet nearly 40% of its electricity needs with emissions-free solar-generated power. This is considered one of the largest of its kind in the East. This solar energy system will reduce New Jersey CO2 emissions by more than 4,200,000 lb (1,900,000 kg) annually; SO2 emissions by 28,000 lb (13,000 kg); and NO2 emissions by 18,000 lb (8,200 kg)., as well as eliminating significant amounts of mercury. Additionally, Marlboro has been recognized as a Cool City by the Sierra Club. Marlboro is the 10th Monmouth County municipality to be named a Cool City.


==== Preston Airfield ====
Marlboro had an airport, Preston Airfield, which opened in 1954 and was in operation for almost 50 years. The airport was opened by Rhea Preston on his farm and consisted of two runways, one was 2,400 feet (730 m) as well as airplane hangars. It obtained a paved runway before 1972. Exact records are not known as to when it changed its name to Marlboro Airport. It is believed to be somewhere between 1975 and 1979. In 1979, the airport was described as having a single runway 2,200 feet (670 m) long. In 2000, the airport was purchased by Marlboro Holdings LLC owned by Anthony Spalliero who closed it with the intent to redevelop the airport into housing. To foster the case for redevelopment, Spalliero donated land holdings he had near the airport to the township Board of Education, which was used to develop the Marlboro Early Learning Center, a school specialized for kindergarten classes. Following a $100,000 pay-off to former Mayor Matthew Scannapieco the planning board used the distance to the new school as justification to close the airfield citing a reference to a fatal plane crash in 1997. Part of the airport has now been developed into Marlboro Memorial Cemetery which now borders the defunct airfield.


==== Virgin Mary sighting ====
Starting in 1989, Joseph Januszkiewicz started reporting visions of the Virgin Mary near the blue spruce trees in his yard at exactly 9:28pm. The visions started to appear six months after he returned from a pilgrimage to Medjugorje in Yugoslavia. Since that time as many as 8,000 pilgrims gathered on the first Sundays of June, July, August and September to pray, meditate and share in the vision. On September 7, 1992, Bishop John C. Reiss gave Januszkiewicz permission to release his messages. In 1993, Catholic Diocese of Trenton ruled that nothing "truly miraculous" was happening at the Januszkiewicz home. Pictures were taken in November 2004 of a mist that showed up at the location of the vision, though by April 2005, Januszkiewicz claimed that the visions had stopped and he reports there have been no sightings since.


=== Historic sites ===


==== Old Saint Gabriel's Church ====
This church was built in 1878. It is located on Route 520, in the Bradeveldt section of Marlboro. The significance of this building was its use by the congregation of St. Gabriel. Organized in 1871 the congregation constructed this Victorian Gothic church in 1878. Although a new church and rectory were constructed on Route 79 in 1972, and a parish center in the 1980s, this building has remained in continuous use. Frequently used for weddings and other similar events.


==== Addison Hobart House ====
The house was built in 1828. It is located on North Main Street in Marlboro, directly next to the fire house. Its significance was the home of Addison Hobart, a businessman, teacher, postmaster, and Commissioner of Deeds. Garrett Hobart, his son, lived in this house and later entered politics, ultimately becoming Vice President of the United States in 1896 under William McKinley. Garrett Hobart died in 1899. The house is currently used as an art studio.


==== Collier Estate ====
The building was built, circa 1904. Its location is: Sisters of the Good Shepherd, Pleasant Valley Road. The significance of the building was a "Rest Hill," an assemblage of many old farmsteads, was purchased for a vacation home by magazine publisher Peter Collier. His son, Robert, was an aviation enthusiast who purchased the first Wright Brothers biplane and housed it at the estate. The porch is a replica of Mt. Vernon. Robert’s widow, Sarah Van Alen, donated the estate in 1927 to the Sisters of the Good Shepherd.


==== The Marlboro Tree ====
Discovered in 1997 and located near one of the Big Brook tributaries, The Marlboro Tree, a massive black willow tree has been certified by the New Jersey Forest Service as a "State Champion" tree, signifying that it is the largest known tree of its species in the State of New Jersey, and the largest tree of any kind in Marlboro Township. It is about 152 years old and measures 76 feet (23 m) high and 19' 8" in circumference. Five grown people must hold hands to fully encircle the tree.


==== Old Scots Burial Grounds ====
On the National Register of Historic Places since August 2001, is Old Scots Burial Grounds, which was established around 1705. Under active study, archaeologist Gerard Scharfenberger is working to excavate the foundation of the original Old Scots Meeting House as well as any unmarked graves on the property. This is the original location where the congregation of the Old Tennent Presbyterian Church once met. It is also part of the site where the Battle of Monmouth was fought. John Boyd, the first Presbyterian minister trained in the New World, was buried here in 1708.


==== Robertsville Elementary School ====
Originally built in 1832, Robertsville Elementary School was once a one-room schoolhouse that was built on the corner of Tennent and Union Hill Roads. It was remodeled/rebuilt in 1912 and used for special education purposes at that time. This building is still standing today. The current Robertsville School was constructed in 1968 down the road from the original schoolhouse. It is believed to have been named after Matthew Roberts, a prominent businessman in the day. In addition to the school use, it was also used for weekly Methodist services by the congregation that evolved into the Robertsville Bible Church.


==== September 11 Memorial ====
A memorial was constructed in memory of the 14 township residents killed as the result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Located near the Marlboro Recreation Center, the memorial consists of a circle of flowering dogwoods, surrounding benches and a memorial fountain on the township municipal grounds. The memorial was badly damaged and is currently being renovated after a serious motor vehicle accident in 2009.


==== Battle of Monmouth ====
The Battle of Monmouth as well as a number of skirmishes were fought near Marlboro Township during the American Revolutionary War. Many area placards and signs can be found on the local roads to identify specific local events from the battle. The Marlboro Township area farms were often raided by the British for food supplies and local livestock taken from area farmers. Following defeat in this battle, the British retreat from the area to their ships in the bay. A local state park, Monmouth Battlefield State Park, nearby in Freehold Township and Manalapan Township provides local reference to this historic event.


==== Liberty Hall/Hardy Blacksmith Shop ====
Liberty Hall also went by the name of Alfred Hardy & Son Blacksmith Shop, was a small brick building located on Route 79 in the small section of Morganville. The building was reportedly built around 1880. The building name could faintly be seen in scripted letters painted over the door of the building. The blacksmith shop operated into the early 20th century and was one of the last blacksmith operations in the area. Following the blacksmith shop closing, the building housed a machine shop until 1942 when a small defense contractor, Lavoie Laboratories bought it to produce radio gear for the military. In 1966, Lavoie sold it to Entron Industries, a manufacturer of missile circuitry that occupied the building until the mid-1970s. The building was torn down in June 2012 after being in disrepair and abandoned.


==== Old Brick Church ====
This church was known as the Freehold-Middletown Dutch Congregation (now Old Brick Church.) The Dutch residents who attended this church names appear in the early records and grave stones dating from 1709 (early records were written in the Dutch language.) In the beginning when services began, circa 1699, the preachers would come across the bay in small boats from Long Island to provide the service to the people of the parish.


==== Federal Hall ====
Built circa 1740 and once owned by the Ely family, the Federal style house resembles a steamboat with a rounded north end. The smokehouse and ice house remain intact. During the early 19th century, the house served as an inn. The house of one of a few of this style left in the country.


==== Beacon Hill ====
Being the second highest point in the county, Col. Asher Holmes was ordered to construct three beacons as part of 23 statewide warning beacons. Used to signal local militia of British invasion, each pyramid of logs was 18 feet (5.5 m) high and 20 feet (6.1 m) wide. When filled with brush and lit, the fires could be seen through the area. It was one of three Monmouth County sites where beacons were placed to warn the residents and the Continental forces if the enemy should approach by the bay.


== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 30.471 square miles (78.921 km2), including 30.361 square miles (78.636 km2) of land and 0.110 square miles (0.285 km2) of water (0.36%). The New Jersey Geological Survey map suggests the land is mostly made up of cretaceous soil consisting of sand, silt and clay.
Morganville (2010 Census population of 5,040) and Robertsville (2010 population of 11,297) are census-designated places and unincorporated communities located within Marlboro Township.

==== Affordable housing ====
As part of its obligation under the Mount Laurel doctrine, the Council on Affordable Housing requires Marlboro Township to provide 1,673 low / moderate income housing units. The first two rounds of New Jersey's affordable housing regulations ran from 1987 to 1999. Under a Regional Contribution Agreement (RCA), Marlboro Township signed an agreement in June 2008 that would have Trenton build or rehabilitate 332 housing units, with Marlboro Township paying $25,000 per unit, a total of $8.3 million to Trenton for taking on the responsibility for these units. Under proposed legislation, municipalities may lose the ability to use these RCAs to pay other communities to accept their New Jersey COAH fair housing obligations, which would mean that Marlboro Township is now required to build the balance of housing. When the New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing requested plans to complete this obligation, Marlboro generated the largest number of objectors to an affordable housing plan in the history of New Jersey. Numerous appeals followed and in October 2010, the Appellate Division struck down portions of the 2007 regulations, invalidated the growth share methodology and directed COAH to develop new regulations. The NJ supreme court granted all petitions for certification in October 2010 and is set to hear the appeals. In June 2011, the Governor issued a reorganization plan which eliminated the 12-member COAH, though state courts overturned the governor's plan.


==== Retirement communities ====
Marlboro Township has a number of retirement communities, which include:
The Royal Pines at Marlboro
The Sunrise Senior Community
Greenbriar North Senior Housing Development. This development contains over 750 homes.
Marlboro Greens - This community was built between 1986 and 1988 contains 341 homes.
Rosemont Estates - Built by Regal Homes, Rosemont Estates offers 242 single-family homes in nine different models and range in size from approximately 2,400 to 2,800 square feet.
The Chelsea Square in Marlboro - for adults aged 55 and better is comprised of 225 condos. Chelsea Square includes a clubhouse, walking and biking trails, and a full-time activities director.


== Parks and recreation ==
Marlboro has a township-sponsored recreation program, with activities for all ages including active soccer and basketball leagues for boys and girls; in addition Little League baseball / softball and Pop Warner football / cheerleading, and a growing amateur wrestling program.
In the summer, the Township holds free outdoor concerts by notable popular music artists. In recent years performers have included Jay and the Americans, Bill Haley's Comets, Lesley Gore, Little Anthony & The Imperials, Johnny Maestro & the Brooklyn Bridge, The Platters, The Trammps, and The Tokens.
In 2007, Marlboro introduced monthly indoor concerts at the recreation center. These shows feature many upcoming artists as well as local talent. Artists have included Marlboro's own Bedlight For Blue Eyes and Sound The Alarm.
Marlboro is also home to the Marlboro Players, a private theater group that holds open auditions for background roles. Formed in 1975, the group presented its first performance, Don't Drink the Water, in the following spring.

Camp Arrowhead (established 1958) is a YMCA summer day camp located on Route 520 across from the abandoned Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital.


=== General parks ===
The Recreation Commission maintains several parks and facilities for public use. However, some ball fields require permits for usage. The following is a list of recreation facilities:


=== Dog parks ===
Marlboro has an off-leash dog park located at the township municipal complex on Wyncrest Road.


=== Fossil collecting ===
Open to the public, Big Brook transects the border of Colts Neck and Marlboro, New Jersey. The stream cuts through sediments that were deposited during the Late Cretaceous period. Reportedly, prolific finds of fossils, such as shark teeth, and other deposits of Cretaceous marine fossils, including belemnites are frequently found. This is a particularly fossiliferous site, with finds including fish teeth, crab and crustacean claws, shark teeth, rarely dinosaur teeth, dinosaur bone fragments (and on a very rare occasion a complete bone), megalodonyx (prehistoric sloth) teeth and bone fragments. The area is regarded as one of the top three dinosaur fossil sites in the state. Multiple dinosaur finds have been found in this area. Most currently, a leg section from a duckbilled dinosaur called a hadrosaur was found. The first dinosaur discovery in North America was made in 1858 in this area. Several bones from a Mastodon were found in 2009 by an individual fossil hunting. Much of the credit for the fossil finds goes to the vast deposits of marl which is known for its preservation value. The fossil beds can be accessed from the bridge on Monmouth Road in Marlboro.


=== Bow hunting ===
Some areas of Monmouth County Big Brook Park allow bow hunting access with a permit.


=== Golf ===
Bella Vista Country Club has an 18 hole course over 5,923 yards with a par of 70. It is considered a Private Non-Equity club.


=== Walking/jogging trail ===
The Henry Hudson Trail goes through parts of Marlboro. In September 2009, the Monmouth County Park System closed a section of the Henry Hudson Trail Southern Extension going through Marlboro Township (Aberdeen Township to Freehold) for 18 months while a portion of the path that runs through the Imperial Oil superfund clean-up site was remediated.

Peppadew Fresh Vineyards


=== Future open space ===
The township has attempted to preserve the areas known as F&F properties, Stattel's Farm and McCarron Farm (also known as Golden Dale Farm) from future development. The last two farms are currently working farms and while the township has purchased the development rights on the property, their fate remains unknown. The development rights of F&F property were purchased for $869,329 to keep the 79-acre (320,000 m2) site as open space.
Open space funding is paid for by a number of sources. State and local sources account for most of the funding. Marlboro obtains the funding from a special tax assessment. The town collects $600,000 annually from a local open space tax assessment of 2 cents per $100 of assessed valuation.


=== Area attractions ===
Marlboro Township is located near some major East Coast recreation attractions. One of the most notable of these attractions is the Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson Township. The Jersey Shore is also another close feature which is located south by taking Route 18 or by taking County Route 520 east. The Freehold Raceway Mall is a super-regional mall anchored by J.C. Penney, Lord & Taylor, Macy's, Nordstrom and Sears. For horse racing, the Freehold Raceway is the oldest half-mile racetrack in the United States, it offers harness racing. The Manasquan Reservoir is 30 minutes south on Route 9 and offers nature and exercise related activities such as fishing, non-powered water sports, bird watching, jogging, biking, and paths for dog walking. The reservoir also has a regionally known Environmental Center offering nature exhibits where people can go see the local wildlife found at the park and region.

Emergency and Non-emergency messages are also able to reach TTY (teletypewriter) phones used by those who are deaf or hard of hearing.


== Government ==


=== Local government ===

Marlboro Township is governed within the Faulkner Act under the Mayor-Council system of municipal government.
The Mayor is elected directly and the Marlboro Township Council is made up of five members, with all elected positions chosenat-large to serve four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with a municipal election conducted every other year on the first Tuesday in November. Two council seats come up for election together with the mayoral seat and the three other council seats come up for vote two years later. At a reorganization meeting held in January after each election, the Council selects a President and Vice-President from among its members. As the township's legislative body, the council sets policies, approves budgets, determines municipal tax rates, and passes resolutions and ordinances to govern the township. The Council also appoints citizen volunteers to certain advisory boards and the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The Council may investigate the conduct of any department, officer or agency of the municipal government. They have full power of subpoena as permitted by statute.
As of 2015, the Mayor of Marlboro Township is Democrat Jonathan Hornik, whose term of office ends December 31, 2015. Members of the Marlboro Township Council are Council President Scott Metzger (2017), Council Vice President Carol Mazzola (2017), Jeff Cantor (2017), Randi Marder (2015) and Michael Scalea (2015; appointed to serve an unexpired term of office).
In January 2015, the Township Council selected Mike Scalea from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the vacant seat expiring in December 2015 of Frank LaRocca, who resigned earlier that month to take a seat as a municipal judge.

== Infrastructure ==


=== Transportation ===


==== Roads and highways ====
As of May 2010, the township had a total of 229.71 miles (369.68 km) of roadways, of which 201.56 miles (324.38 km) were maintained by the municipality, 11.05 miles (17.78 km) by Monmouth County and 17.10 miles (27.52 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.
The car is the most common mode of transportation in Marlboro Township. The main public thoroughfares in Marlboro Township are U.S. Route 9, Route 18, County Route 520 and Route 79. These routes provide access to major highways including the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. Taxi services are also available through a number of local private companies.


==== Public transportation ====
There are multiple public transportation options available, including bus, rail, air and ferry service. NJ Transit provides bus service to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan on the 131, 135 and 139 routes; on the 64 and 67 and from both Jersey City and Newark. The Matawan train station is a heavily used train station on New Jersey Transit's North Jersey Coast Line, providing service to New York Pennsylvania Station via Secaucus Junction, with a transfer available for trains to Newark Liberty International Airport. However, both options provide significant problems in terms of lack of available parking, which may require waiting periods of more than a year for a permit and private parking options are very expensive.
Ferry service is available through the SeaStreak service in Highlands, a trip that involves about a 45-minute drive on secondary roads from Marlboro Township to reach the departing terminal. SeaStreak offers ferry service to New York City with trips to Pier 11 (on the East River at Wall Street) and East 35th Street in Manhattan.
Following the closure of the Marlboro Airport, Monmouth Executive Airport in Farmingdale, Old Bridge Airport and Mar Bar L Farms municipal airport supply short-distance flights to surrounding areas and are now the closest air transportation services. The closest major airport is Newark Liberty International Airport, which is 33.1 miles (53.3 km) (about 42 minutes drive) from the center of Marlboro Township.


=== Health care ===

The closest major university hospitals are Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick and Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune Township.


== Contaminated and Superfund sites ==


=== Underground storage tanks ===
The NJDEP lists 39 known locations of underground storage tank contamination in Marlboro Township.


=== Burnt Fly Bog ===
Located off Tyler Lane and Spring Valley Road on the Old Bridge Township border, the area of Burnt Fly Bog in Marlboro Township is listed as a Superfund clean-up site. It is a rural area covering approximately 1,700 acres (6.9 km2), most of it in Marlboro Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey. During the 1950s and early 1960s, many unlined lagoons were used for storage of waste oil. As a result, at least 60 acres (240,000 m2) of the bog have been contaminated. In addition to the current contaminated area, the site still consists of: four lagoons; an approximately 13,000-cubic-yard mound of sludge; and an undetermined number of exposed and buried drums. The site is a ground water discharge area for the Englishtown Aquifer. In this bog, ground water, surface water, and air are contaminated by oil and various organic chemicals. Contaminants known to be present include ethylbenzene, methylene chloride, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, base neutral acids, metals, PAHs, PCBs, unknown liquid waste, and VOCs.
A number of studies have been mounted starting in 1981. At that time the EPA awarded a Cooperative Agreement and funds to New Jersey under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Early in 1982, EPA used CERCLA funds to install a 900-foot (270 m) fence and repair a 6-foot (1.8 m) section of a dike. In 1983, the state completed (1) a field investigation to study the ground water, (2) a feasibility study for removal of contaminated soil and drums, and (3) a feasibility study for closing the site. EPA and the state continue negotiating agreements for further cleanup activities.
Up to the year 2003, 33,600 cubic yards or sedimentation, sludge and soil have been removed for disposal and incineration. The area was then back filled with top soil. In June 2011 a 5-year review of the site was published. At that time the remediation status was complete as of date: 9/21/2004. Finally a fence has been installed around the entire site to restrict access and protect human health but has been breached in several locations. The downstream area was cleaned up to residential levels. It was recommended that the NJDEP continued monitoring off Site groundwater for five years. The final suggestion was "Since hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants remain at the Site which do not allow for unlimited use or unrestricted exposure, in accordance with 40 CFR 300.430 (f) (4) (ii), the remedial action for the Site shall be reviewed no less often than every five years. EPA will conduct another five-year review prior to June 2016."


=== Imperial Oil Co. ===
This 15-acre (61,000 m2) part of land was owned by Imperial Oil Co./Champion Chemicals. The site was added to the National Priorities List of Superfund sites in 1983. The site consists of six production, storage, and maintenance buildings and 56 above-ground storage tanks. Known contamination includes PCBs, arsenic, lead and total petroleum hydrocarbons. A number of companies may have been responsible for waste oil discharges and arsenical pesticides released to a nearby stream as industrial operations date back to 1912. The area is protected by a fence that completely encloses it. This site is being addressed through Federal and State actions. Mayor Hornik of Marlboro Township, described the polluted site as "one of the worst in the country."
In 1991, EPA excavated and disposed of an on-site waste filter clay pile. In 1997, EPA posted warning signs on the Henry Hudson Trail which is located near the site and the tarp covering the remaining waste filter clay pile was replaced to prevent human contact and limit the migration of the contamination. Arsenic and metals continued to be found in soils in the vicinity of this site. In April 2002, EPA excavated and disposed of a 25-foot (7.6 m) by 25-foot (7.6 m) area of soil containing a tar-like material discovered outside of the fenced area. The presence of elevated levels of PCBs and lead in this material may have presented a physical contact threat to trespassers. In April 2004, 18,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil were removed from Birch Swamp Brook and adjacent properties. In August 2007, EPA arranged for 24-hour security at the site, given that Imperial Oil declared bankruptcy and ceased operations at the site during July 2007.
The EPA announced in 2009 the start-up of remediation activities for contaminated soils at the site now called "Operable Unit 3" (OU3). Marlboro Township has benefited from the $10–$25 million in stimulus funding to pay for the cost of this cleanup.
On May 3, 2012, the EPA held a press conference. The spokesman "Enck said a $50 million effort over 25 years has cleaned the property, removing 4,600 gallons of oil that pooled on the land, along with 30 million gallons of ground water and 180,000 cubic yards of soil." A total of $17 million for the clean-up came from the federal Superfund program, with $33 million from the American Resource and Recovery Act.


=== Marlboro Middle School ===
Marlboro Middle School contamination issue was an issue which was handled by the state and local level. It was not a Superfund site. This field was an Angus bull farm prior to being donated to the town for school construction. During the soccer fields improvement program, tests were conducted at the soccer complex which showed elevated levels of unspecified contaminants. The Mayor closed the fields as soon as the test results came in. The township then applied for and received a grant to help with the remediation work. Marlboro received money from the Hazardous Discharge Site Remediation Fund to conduct soil remediation at the soccer fields.


=== Entron Industries site ===
This property clean-up is being handled through the NJEDA and is not considered a Superfund clean-up site. The site is located at the northeastern intersection of Route 79 and Beacon Hill Road. There were a total of 10 buildings on the site along with wooded areas. Investigations found the presence of a variety of unspecified environmental contaminants associated with the construction of rocket launcher parts. In addition, investigations included possible groundwater contamination on the property. There are no current known plans for clean-up, however, public hearings have been held to start the process of clean-up and redevelopment of the area. Marlboro township was given a total of $200,000 in two different grants to complete remedial investigation of the site by the NJEDA. The mayor has suggested it may take up to $5 million to clean up the land.
After a number of public hearings, on July 14, 2011, a resolution was put forth authorizing the execution of the redevelopment agreement between The Township Of Marlboro And K-Land Corporation For The Property Known As Tax Block 132, Lot 18 (the Entron Industries site). The developer suggested an investment of $100 million to clean up and develop the site. The site is currently under redevelopment. K-land and Marlboro reached an agreement for the development of the Property to include 365 residential units, thirty-three percent of which would be set aside as affordable units. The Redeveloper created "Camelot at Marlboro". This housing development has been completed and the property has been restored.


=== Arky property ===
This is a non-Superfund clean-up site with focus by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. It is located at 217 Route 520 in Marlboro Township. This 22-acre (89,000 m2) site was an automobile junkyard. Contamination consisted of volatile organic compounds in the groundwater and soil contamination of metals, trichloroethylene (TCE), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Initial clean-up consisted of removal of the contaminated soil. Also found were buried drums of unknown product. There were 22 drums removed. In 1998, NJDEP conducted a second drum removal action. They excavated 70 buried drums and removed some of the contaminated soil around the drums. The drums of hazardous wastes had been crushed and buried prior to 1987. To further monitor the property, NJDEP has installed additional monitor wells near the site to collect ground water samples. Investigations are continuing to determine if additional contamination is present on the site which would require clean-up actions.


=== DiMeo property ===
This 77-acre (310,000 m2) property was purchased by Marlboro Township under P.B. 938-05 for recreational uses, including walking-jogging trails, a playground area and a picnic grove area. The property is located at Pleasant Valley and Conover roads. Clean-up is being handled through the NJEDA and is not considered a Superfund clean-up site. In 2004, Schoor DePalma addressed the contaminated soil on the property. The soil on this property had widespread hazardous levels of arsenic, lead, pesticides and petroleum related contamination; consistent with farming related operations. Additionally, the property contains a pond that is polluted with arsenic.
After clean-up, deep monitoring wells were created. In 2007, Birdsall Engineering investigated arsenic and pesticide contamination on the property. Two isolated hot spots were found with high levels of pesticides. The clean-up work was funded by the state farmland preservation program. In 2008, Marlboro Township received state funds for continued clean-up and monitoring by the NJEDA.
This property is on the border of the land that formerly housed the Marlboro State Psychiatric Hospital. This presents its own possibilities, should the Township of Marlboro purchase the hospital property.


=== Big Brook Park ===
This site is being addressed through state and local department and funds and is not a superfund clean-up site. In 1997, the Monmouth County Park System bought 378 acres (1.53 km2) of the closed Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital land. The intent is to create a regional park, similar to Holmdel Park. It is also expected to be home to part of the Henry Hudson Trail. The plans for the property have not been completed, in part due to potential environmental contamination. Preliminary environmental studies by Birdsall Engineering found asbestos and oil contamination on the grounds. The land is contaminated with arsenic, reportedly a byproduct of farming. In an attempt to further classify the contamination, the Luis Berger Group has done further testing on this site. They are reporting that the arsenic found on the site is "actually a naturally occurring condition in local and regional soil in this area". Additionally they reported that the site contamination found in the prior study was caused by a number of factors, including a former septic system (Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital discharged the effluent from the hospital into Big Brook), pesticide mixing building, fuel oil underground storage tank, and construction debris. This evaluation made the following recommendations to the NJDEP:
Tank storage closure and removal—Excavation of surficial soils along with post excavation sampling
Removal of septic systems
Asbestos abatement
Wetlands restoration


=== Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital ===
The site of the closed Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital has on-site contamination—it is not considered a Superfund clean-up site. Mayor Jonathan Hornik estimates it could cost more than $11 million to clean up. Mayor Jonathan Hornik stated that the state clearly has the responsibility for cleaning up the site. He however, stated that in the interest of getting it done, the township may have to show some flexibility in helping the state defray the costs. In addition to the contamination on the site, the old buildings from the hospital are now in a state of decay and are being demolished.


=== Murray property ===
This site is being addressed through state and local funds and is not considered a Superfund clean-up site. The property is contaminated with an undisclosed substance. To clean up the contamination, 1,708 cubic yards of soil was removed. The site is located on Prescott Drive, Block 233 Lot 13.


== Sister cities ==
Marlboro has two sister cities:
 Nanto, Japan
 Wujiang, China
Marlboro's first sister city, Nanto was formerly known as Johana. It was officially Marlboro's sister city in August 1991. The mayor, Saul Hornik, signed the agreement for the exchange program with Johana's mayor. Marlboro's second sister city, Wujiang is an urban city in Jiangsu Province of southeast China. It has been regarded for "The Land of Rice and Fish" and "The Capital of Silk". It is recently known for being the "Capital of Electronics". Wujiang officially became a sister city with Marlboro in December 2011.
