Hypersalivation (also called ptyalism or sialorrhea) is excessive production of saliva. It has also been defined as increased amount of saliva in the mouth, which may also be caused by decreased clearance of saliva.
Hypersalivation can contribute to drooling if there is an inability to keep the mouth closed or in difficulty in swallowing the excess saliva (dysphagia).
Hypersalivation also often precedes emesis (vomiting), where it accompanies nausea (a feeling of needing to vomit).


== Causes ==


=== Excessive production ===
Conditions that can cause saliva overproduction include:
Rabies
Gastroesophageal reflux disease, in such cases specifically called a water brash, and is characterized by a sour fluid or almost tasteless saliva in the mouth
Pregnancy
Excessive starch intake
Pancreatitis
Liver disease
Serotonin syndrome
Mouth ulcers
Oral infections
Medications that can cause overproduction of saliva include:
clozapine
pilocarpine
ketamine
potassium chlorate
risperidone
rabeprazole sodium (Aciphex)
Toxins that can cause hypersalivation include:
mercury
copper
organophosphates (insecticide)
arsenic


=== Decreased clearance ===
Causes of decreased clearance of saliva include:
Infections such as tonsillitis, retropharyngeal and peritonsillar abscesses, epiglottitis and mumps.
Problems with the jaw, e.g., fracture or dislocation
Radiation therapy
Neurologic disorders such as myasthenia gravis, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, rabies, bulbar paralysis, bilateral facial nerve palsy, and hypoglossal nerve palsy.


== Treatment ==
Hypersalivation is optimally treated by treating or avoiding the underlying cause. Mouthwash and tooth brushing may have drying effects.
