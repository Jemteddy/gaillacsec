"Panomics" or 'pan-omics' is a term used to refer to the range of molecular biology technologies including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and so forth, or the integration of their combined use. Often systems biology approaches applied based upon the use of panomic analysis data.
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to "the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information."
