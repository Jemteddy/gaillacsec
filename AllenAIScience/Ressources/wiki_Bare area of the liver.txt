The bare area of the liver (nonperitoneal area) is a large triangular surface of the liver devoid of peritoneal covering.
The coronary ligaments represent reflections of the visceral peritoneum covering the liver onto the diaphragm. As such, between the two layers of the coronary ligament lies the bare area of the liver, and is attached to the diaphragm by areolar tissue.
The bare area of the liver is still covered by Glisson's capsule, the fibrous capsule that sheathes the entire liver.


== Clinical significance ==
The bare area of the liver is clinically important because it represents a site where infection can spread from the abdominal cavity to the thoracic cavity.
