Hair-cutting shears are scissors that are specifically designed for cutting hair. They are also known as barber shears, hairdressing shears, or hair shears. Hair-cutting shears are significantly sharper than scissors, and designed specifically for cutting hair. Shears range in size from about 5 to 7 inches (13 to 18 cm) long. They commonly have an appendage, known as a finger brace or tang, attached to one of the finger rings. This gives the user additional control when cutting.


== Texturizing shears ==

A specialized type of hair-cutting shears known as texturizing shears are used to reduce hair thickness, to create special texturizing effects, or to blend layered hair. Texturizing shears have a pair of pivoted blades in the same way as normal shears, but one or both blades have teeth on the edge like a comb. Texturing shears may also be called "thinning shears" or "chunking shears".
