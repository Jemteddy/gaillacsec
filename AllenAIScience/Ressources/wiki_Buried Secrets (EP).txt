== Reception ==
The Allmusic review by Steve Huey states "Although this is experimental music, it works quite well — it's actually more sinister and menacing than many death metal groups. Very dark and very disturbing, 27 minutes is almost too much to handle". Guy Peters stated "Sometimes I wonder what it is that makes me check out music like this. Is it the brutality, the ugliness, the potential to offend, the randomness, the explicit cover art? Most people wouldn’t even call this ‘music’ when facing a .44 at close range. It must be the sheer extremity of it all that attracts me... Buried Secrets isn’t even a good album, but it sure is an experience".
