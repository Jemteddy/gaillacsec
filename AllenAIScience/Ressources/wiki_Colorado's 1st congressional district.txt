Colorado's 1st congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Colorado based primarily in the City and County of Denver in the central part of the state. The district includes all of the City and County of Denver and the nearby suburbs of Glendale, Englewood, Sheridan, and Cherry Hills Village.
The district has been represented by Democrat Diana DeGette since 1997.
Based in the heart of Metropolitan Denver, this district is by far the most liberal district in the non-coastal parts of the American West and the most liberal district in the western US outside of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle. While there is some GOP strength in the suburban areas, the GOP strength here is no match for the overwhelming Democratic tilt of the City of Denver.

== Characteristics ==
As with most urban districts, Colorado's 1st Congressional District is racially diverse and has proven to be friendly territory for Democrats. Only two Republicans have been elected to the district's Congressional seat since the Great Depression. Dean M. Gillespie was the district's representative from 1944 to 1947, and Mike McKevitt served one term from 1970 to 1972, winning thanks to an ideological split among Denver Democrats.
