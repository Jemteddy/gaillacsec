Cream soda is a sweet carbonated soft drink, often flavored with vanilla.


== History and development ==
A recipe for cream soda—written by E.M. Sheldon and published in Michigan Farmer in 1852—called for water, cream of tartar, Epsom salts, sugar, tartaric acid, egg, and milk, to be mixed, then heated, and when cool mixed with water and a quarter teaspoonful of soda (sodium bicarbonate) to make an effervescent drink.
Alexander C. Howell, of Vienna, New Jersey, was granted a patent for "cream soda-water" on June 27, 1865. Howell's cream soda water was made with sodium bicarbonate, water, sugar, egg whites, wheat flour, and "any of the usual flavoring materials" such as oil of lemon, extracts of vanilla, and pineapple to "suit the taste" before drinking, the cream soda water was mixed with water and an acid such as tartaric acid or citric acid. In Canada, James William Black of Berwick, Nova Scotia was granted a U.S. patent on December 8, 1885, and a Canadian patent on July 5, 1886, for "ice-cream soda". Black's ice-cream soda, which contained whipped egg whites, sugar, lime juice, lemons, citric acid, flavoring, and bicarbonate of soda, was a concentrated syrup that could be reconstituted into an effervescent beverage by adding ordinary ice water.

==== Australia ====
In Australia, cream soda is generally known as creaming soda or creamy soda by current manufacturers and is generally pink, red or brown. Less commonly, there is a bright yellow type of creaming soda, an example of which is produced by Crows Nest Soft Drinks, or Hartz. Another example is Saxbys Soft Drinks' Crème Soda, which is produced in Taree, NSW. Manufacturers of creaming soda in Australia include Bundaberg Brewed Drinks, Kirks, River Port, Schweppes and Tarax. As of 2005, Kirks creaming soda was made and distributed by Coca-Cola Amatil. Up until the mid-1990s, Kirks also produced Snow Cap, which was essentially the vanilla flavored brown version of the drink. The name "Snow Cap" was created to differentiate the pink and brown versions of the drink. While Snow Cap is no longer produced, Kirks do produce a product called 'Sno-Drop'. Schweppes Australia markets creaming Soda as part of their 'Schweppes Traditional' line of soft drinks. Until recently it was deep red in all states except Victoria where it was brown, but now both varieties are offered. The flavor is also different between the red and brown versions of 'Schweppes Traditional' with the red version having a small amount of raspberry flavor added to it. South Australian soft drink manufacturer Woodroofe produces "Sno-Top", a brown creaming soda drink. A second South Australian soft drink and cordial manufacturer Bickford's markets a deep red colored creaming soda. Golden Circle is another a popular brand of creaming soda.


==== New Zealand ====
This is known as Creaming soda, Ice cream soda, Chill drink or cream soda, though the flavor changes are negligible. It is usually a bright yellow color or a white opaque. It is one of the many flavors sold by Foxton Fizz It is also one of the many carbonated drink-flavors offered by Golden Circle.


=== Europe ===
Another variety is one referred to as Italian cream soda. This is usually a mixture of carbonated water and half and half or cream combined with vanilla syrup. Ratios vary widely, but the taste is usually that of sweetened, flavored milk.


==== Netherlands ====
The Netherlands had a somewhat similar milkbased drink, called Frizz. It was sold by a dairy company named Friesland Foods. It is currently owned by FrieslandCampina, but Frizz is no longer in production and the brandname will expire in 2019. It is said to have been caramel-colored.
However, Asian supermarkets (called toko's) usually sell Schweppes Cream Soda. The cream sodas are imported from Hong Kong.


==== United Kingdom ====
In the UK, cream soda was traditionally served with a dessert-spoonful of vanilla ice cream floating on the top, but this became a rarity in recent years. It is vanilla flavoured, slightly glutinous and has a uniquely thick, "soft" and long-lasting foam. A.G. Barr, Ben Shaw's (a Cott brand), and DG Jamaica manufacture their own brands of cream soda, and most supermarkets manufacture it under their own brand.


=== Asia ===

In Hong Kong, the Swire Coca Cola Company markets a yellow Schweppes Cream Soda. Some people enjoy Cream Soda in a 1:1 ratio with fresh milk.
In India, two brands of cream soda are Cottons and Bijoli.
In Japan, "cream soda" is a term used for an ice cream float made with melon-flavored soda topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
In Malaysia, the F&N or Fraser and Neave brand makes a clear Ice Cream Soda.
Pakistan's popular brand is Pakola Ice Cream Soda (پاكولا, Pākōlā), which is green in color.
In Sri Lanka, Elephant House Cream Soda is most popular soft drink. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka launched their newest flavor, "Fanta Cream Soda", in July 2009.
In Thailand, Hale's Trading produces Hale's Blue Boy Brand Cream Soda Flavoured Syrup. A green colored rose/floral flavored cordial. This is mixed 1 part to 4 parts water/soda water to get a cream soda drink, very similar to the South African Creme Soda. Or used as a flavoring in their shaved iced deserts. This syrup is sold world-wide in some Asian food stores. Additionally, PepsiCo's division in Thailand produces a green cream flavored soda under their brand name Mirinda.


=== Africa ===

In South Africa and Zimbabwe, cream soda is sold under the label Sparletta Creme Soda, a product of the Coca-Cola company. It is green in color.
In South Africa, cream soda is also used as a mixer with cane spirit (an inexpensive alcoholic beverage distilled from fermented sugarcane). Cane spirit is chosen due its ability to go relatively unnoticed.
