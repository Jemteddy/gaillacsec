== Equity Service Centers ==
The RSU has six Equity Service Centres: The Centre for Women & Trans People, The Good Food Centre, Racialised Students’ Collective, RyeACCESS, RyePRIDE, and the Trans Collective. These centres serve as a space for students from different marginalized backgrounds to come together and organize equity and social justice initiatives, events, and campaigns.
In 2010, The Board of Directors voted to change the name from "Community Service Groups" to "Equity Service Centers" to better reflect their mandate.
The Equity Service Centres each have their own office on the second floor of the Student Centre and are open to all students, so drop by and get involved!
