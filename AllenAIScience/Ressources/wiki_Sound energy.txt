Sound energy is a form of energy associated with the vibration or disturbance of matter. The SI unit of sound energy is the joule (J). Sound is a mechanical wave and as such consists physically in oscillatory elastic compression and in oscillatory displacement of a fluid. Therefore, the medium acts as storage for both potential and kinetic energy as well.
Consequently, the sound energy in a volume of interest is defined as the sum of the potential and kinetic energy densities integrated over that volume:

where
V is the volume of interest;
p is the sound pressure;
v is the particle velocity;
ρ0 is the density of the medium without sound present;
ρ is the local density of the medium;
c is the speed of sound.
