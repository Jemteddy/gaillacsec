Arizona's 4th congressional district is a congressional district located in the U.S. state of Arizona. It stretches from the periphery of Phoenix to contain much of the rural western and northwestern portion of the state.
It is currently represented by Republican Paul Gosar.
The current 4th was created after the 2010 census from portions of the old 1st, 2nd, 5th and 5th districts. Prior to 2013, the 4th District was a majority-Latino district located entirely in Maricopa County; most of that area is now the 7th District.
