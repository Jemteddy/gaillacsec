The foreign body granuloma is a response of biological tissue to any foreign material in the tissue. Tissue-encapsulation of an implant is part of this. An infection around a splinter is part of this, too.
The presence of the implant changes the healing response, and this is called the foreign-body reaction (FBR). FBR consists of: protein adsorption, macrophages, multinucleated foreign body giant cells (macrophage fusion), fibroblasts, and angiogenesis.
It can be caused by beryllium.
