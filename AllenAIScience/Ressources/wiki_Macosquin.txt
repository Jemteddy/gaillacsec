== History ==
The origins of Macosquin date from a 6th-century monastic settlement and the village was home to a Cistercian Abbey in the 12th century. Features remain from its later growth as a Plantation village laid out at the beginning of the 17th century by The Merchant Taylors. Earlier spellings of the village's name are Moycosquin and Moycoscain.
Following fast growth in the 1950s and 1960s the village had a peak population of over 800 in the 1970s, but this has shrunk to a 2001 population of 596.
