14 Andromedae or 14 And is an orange giant star approximately 258 light-years away in the constellation of Andromeda. The star is a suspected variable star. It is thought that 14 Andromedae was formerly an A- or F-type main-sequence star early in its life. As of 2008, an extrasolar planet is thought to be orbiting the star, being one of the few known planets to be orbiting an evolved intermediate-mass star.


== Planetary system ==
In 2008, a planet (designated 14 Andromedae b) was announced to be orbiting the star. The planet was found to have a minimum mass of 4.8 Jupiter masses and orbiting in a circular orbit that takes 186 days to complete. The planet is one of the innermost planets around an evolved intermediate-mass star (such planets have only been discovered in clump giants).
The planet and its host star is one of the planetary systems selected by the International Astronomical Union as part of their public process for giving proper names to exoplanets and their host star (where no proper name already exists). The process involves public nomination and voting for the new names, and the IAU plans to announce the new names in mid-November 2015.
