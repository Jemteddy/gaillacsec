The lateral dorsal nucleus is a nucleus of the thalamus.
It acts in concert with the anterior nuclei of thalamus.
It receives significant input from several subdivisions of visual cortex, and has a primary output to parietal cortex on the dorsolateral cortical convexity, giving it access to limbic forebrain nuclei important for emotion and behavior functions.
