Championship Bowling (チャンピオンシップボーリング, Chanpionshippu Bōringu) is a bowling video game developed by Romstar in 1989 for the arcade and Nintendo Entertainment System. It was one of the few games that supported the Four Score accessory for the NES, allowing for four people to play.

The object of the game is the same as a regular game of bowling; score the highest to win. The game utilizes factors such as left or right-handedness, spin, power, and weight of the ball, which can affect the outcome of a throw.
