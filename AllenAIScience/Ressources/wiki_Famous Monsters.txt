Famous Monsters is a 1999 album by the Misfits. It is the second in the post-Danzig era of the band, and the last album to feature Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein, Michale Graves, and Dr. Chud, who would all quit the band in 2000. The album's title is an allusion to the horror magazine Famous Monsters of Filmland. The UK release also exclusively includes the song "1,000,000 Years BC", which was later re-released on Cuts from the Crypt in 2001.
The song "Scream!" was turned into a music video directed by George A. Romero. In addition, the band appeared in Romero's film Bruiser. "Kong at the Gates" was the theme music for WCW alumnus Vampiro.
The song "Descending Angel" was re-recorded and released as a single in 2013, with Jerry Only on lead vocals.
