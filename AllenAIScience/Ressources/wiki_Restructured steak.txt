Restructured steak is a catch-all term to describe a class of imitation beef steaks made from smaller pieces of beef fused together by a binding agent. Its development started from the 1970s. Allowed food-grade agents include:
Sodium chloride (table salt) and phosphate salts. Salt can prevent microbiological growth and make myosin-type proteins more soluble. The allowed amount of phosphate in end products is 0.5% in the U.S. It increases the emulsification of fat.
Animal blood plasma
Alginate: Sodium alginate forms an adhesive gel in the presence of Ca2+ ion.
Transglutaminase: an enzyme that helps the forming of cross-binding proteins.


== ProblemsEdit ==
Oxidation and food poisoning are the two most serious issues generally associated with restructured steak. To reduce the risk of food poisoning, restructured steaks should always be cooked until well-done.
