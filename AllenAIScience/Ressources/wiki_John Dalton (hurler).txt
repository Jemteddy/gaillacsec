== Playing career ==


=== Club ===
Dalton has enjoyed great success with the Carrickshock club in all grades of competition.
After winning under-16, minor and under-21 county championships, Dalton joined the club's top team in the early 2000s. After losing back-to-back county finals at intermediate level, Carrickshock triumphed in 2004 with a win over Mooncoin. The club subsequently represented Kilkenny in the provincial series of games and ended the year as Leinster champions. The great run of success for Dalton's club came to an end in the All-Ireland final, when Kildangan of Tipperary defeated Carrickshock by 2-13 to 1-13.
