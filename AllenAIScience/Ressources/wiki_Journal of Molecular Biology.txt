The Journal of Molecular Biology is a peer-reviewed scientific journal published weekly by Elsevier. It covers original scientific research concerning studies of organisms or their components at the molecular level.


== Notable articles ==
Some of the most highly cited articles that have appeared in the Journal of Molecular Biology since its inception in April 1959 include:
"On the nature of allosteric transitions: a plausible model,"  in 1965, in which Jacques Monod, Jeffries Wyman, and Jean-Pierre Changeux presented the MWC model, that explained the cooperativity exhibited by allosteric proteins, such as hemoglobin.
"Detection of Specific Sequences Among DNA Fragments Separated by Gel-Electrophoresis," in 1975, in which Edwin Southern presented the first description of nucleic acid blotting, a technique that revolutionized the field of molecular biology.
"Identification of Common Molecular Subsequences," in 1981, in which the Smith–Waterman algorithm for determining the degree of homology of DNA, RNA, or protein sequences was first described.
"Basic Local Alignment Search Tool," in 1990, in which the nucleic acid and protein homology search algorithm known as BLAST was originally described.


== Ranking and impact factor ==
