San Carlos volcanic field is a monogenetic volcanic field in Arizona. The field lies within the San Carlos Apache Reservation about 40 km (25 mi) east of Globe, Arizona. It is a small field covering approximately 50 km2 or less of volcanic cones and lava flows. The basanite to hawaiite basaltic flows contain xenoliths of peridotite. The Peridot Mesa vent is noted for the occurrence of quantities of gem quality peridot found within lherzolite xenolith nodules.
