Italian X Rays is the thirteenth album by American rock band The Steve Miller Band, released in 1984. "Who Do You Love?" and "Out of the Night" were songs co-written by Steve Miller and Tim Davis. Tim Davis had been a co-founder of the Steve Miller Band and had been a drummer, singer and songwriter with the band during its first five albums, released between 1968 and 1970. As of 1984, Davis was suffering from the effects of diabetes, and died four years later.
Referring to "Out of the Night", Steve Miller wrote, in the liner notes to the Steve Miller Band Box Set (1994), "This is the last song I wrote with Tim Davis. Tim was dying at the time from diabetes and it had taken a terrible toll on him. But he never lost his good humor."
