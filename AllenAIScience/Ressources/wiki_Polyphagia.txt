Polyphagia or hyperphagia is excessive hunger or increased appetite. It derives from the Greek words πολύς (polys) which means "very much" or "many", and φαγῶ (phago) meaning "eating" or "devouring".

In medicine, polyphagia (sometimes known as hyperphagia) is a medical sign meaning excessive hunger and abnormally large intake of solids by mouth. It can be caused by disorders such as diabetes, Kleine–Levin syndrome (a malfunction in the hypothalamus), and the genetic disorders Prader–Willi syndrome and Bardet–Biedl syndrome.


== CausesEdit ==
Causes of increased appetite include:
Anxiety
Depression
Certain drugs
Diabetes mellitus
Hyperthyroidism
Hypoglycemia
Premenstrual syndrome
Prader-Willi syndrome

Graves' disease


=== Diabetic ketoacidosisEdit ===
Polyphagia usually occurs early in the course of diabetic ketoacidosis. However, once insulin deficiency becomes more severe and ketoacidosis develops, appetite is suppressed.
