== History ==
On July 4, 1975 Chanan Avital was injured in the Ben Yehuda Street Bombing in Zion Square, Jerusalem. After he recovered he decided to arrange a hasidic music festival for children. The result of this was the establishment of a choir. Since then Avital has established around 22 choirs all over the world, his main one being the Jerusalem Boys Choir.
The first album was entitled: “Hasidic Music Festival for Children” which included Hasidic tracks. A series of four albums followed entitled “Sukkat David” which included Mizrahi tracks.
The choir performs around the world including Argentina, Brazil, Morocco, Panama and Tunisia. The choir sings three times a year in France. The choir sings in a range of various genres ranging form Oriental to Hasidic and even Yiddish and foreign hits.
