== Music video ==

The music video for "Because" was directed by Mike Corte and David Murrell, and premiered on YouTube on 29 May 2009. The video opens with a drop of water evaporating from a large puddle then quickly cuts to a portrait shot of Mauboy looking towards the camera as she sings the lines, "It's all because." The next scene displays Mauboy standing on a thin layor of shallow water with pages of text individually floating in the air. Rain kicks in as it pours down on Mauboy and reoccurs throughout the video. The portrait shot also keeps recurring along with many objects falling into a puddle of water, such as a vase, a photo of Mauboy and her ex-boyfriend, and an ink container. Mauboy worked with stylist Michael Azzollini to create an ultra-glam Beyoncé-inspired look for the video.
