In September 2010 Former Energy and Petroleum Ministry PS Patrick Nyoike announced that Kenya aims to build a 1,000 MW nuclear power plant between 2017 and 2022. For Kenya to achieve middle-income status, nuclear energy has been determined to be the best way to produce safe, clean, reliable and base load (constant supply) electricity. The projected cost using South Korean technology is US$3.5 billion. Nuclear and renewable sources of energy such as wind, solar and geothermal plants could play a major role in helping Kenya achieve middle income status, as the reduction of carbon emissions becomes a higher priority.


== Nuclear Energy programme ==
Kenya has embarked on a programme to see the country generate 1 GW (1,000 MW) from Nuclear sources between 2020 and 2022. By 2030 Kenya is slated to have installed a capacity of 4 GW of Nuclear energy, generating about 19% of Kenya's energy needs. Meaning that nuclear power will be the second largest source of energy in Kenya coming only second after geothermal power which is also a clean form of energy.
The Kenya Nuclear Electricity Board is in charge of spearheading this sector in the country.


== Capacity-building programme ==
15 students sponsored by Government of Kenya (GoK) for Masters in Nuclear Science at The University of Nairobi
11 Kenyan students currently studying at The KEPCO International Nuclear Graduate School (KINGS) under sponsorship by both the Government of Korea and Kenya.
11 more scholarships are being offered for Kenyan students to study nuclear operations in Slovakia.
