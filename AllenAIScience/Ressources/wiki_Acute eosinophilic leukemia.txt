Acute eosinophilic leukemia (AEL) is a rare subtype of acute myeloid leukemia with 50 to 80 percent of eosinophilic cells in the blood and marrow. It can arise de novo or may develop in patients having the chronic form of a hypereosinophilic syndrome. Patients with acute eosinophilic leukemia have a propensity for developing bronchospasm and heart failure from endomyocardial fibrosis. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are more common than in other variants of AML.


== Diagnosis ==
A specific histochemical reaction, cyanide-resistant peroxidase, permits identification of leukemic blast cells with eosinophilic differentiation and diagnosis of acute eosinoblastic leukemia in some cases of AML with few identifiable eosinophils in blood or marrow.


== Treatment and prognosis ==
Acute eosinophilic leukemia is treated as other subtypes of AML. Response to treatment is approximately the same as in other types of AML.
