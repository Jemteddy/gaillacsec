Mitochondrially encoded 12S RNA (often abbreviated as 12S) is a 959 nt long mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In humans, 12S is encoded by the MTRNR1 gene.
All animal mitochondria genomes contain 37 genes: 2 rRNA, 22 tRNA and 13 mRNA. These are very useful in phylogenetic studies, in particular the 12S and 16S rRNAs.
Mutations in the MTRNR1 gene may be associated with hearing loss.
