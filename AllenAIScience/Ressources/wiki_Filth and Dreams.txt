Swing Out Sister's sixth album, Filth and Dreams, was released in Japan in March 1999, and it remains the only album not released in any other country. This album featured stronger jazz leanings than some of their early pop-oriented albums, and is restrained in mood. For this record, SOS adapted to the growing popularity of hip-hop in the late '90s.
Filth and Dreams is the first album by the group not released in their native England, and is currently the most difficult CD to find.
