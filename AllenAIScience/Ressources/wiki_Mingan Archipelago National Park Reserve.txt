The Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve is a national park reserve located in the eastern area of Quebec, Canada, on the north shore of Gulf of St. Lawrence. It features the Mingan Archipelago, a chain of around 40 islands.

The islands formed as the continent slowly rose after the last glaciation. Over the course of the last few thousand years, the limestone rocks were slowly eroded by the waves, the changing sea level and the winds, as well as seasonal freezing and thawing. The result is a unique set of limestone sculptures, which form the largest group of such monoliths in Canada.
Mingan Archipelago was represented in the 2011 documentary film series National Parks Project, with its film directed by Catherine Martin and scored by Sebastien Grainger, Jennifer Castle and Dan Werb.
