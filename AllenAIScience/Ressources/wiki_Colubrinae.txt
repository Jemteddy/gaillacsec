The Colubrinae are a subfamily of the Colubridae family of snakes. It includes numerous genera, and taxonomic sources often disagree on the exact number. It is the largest subfamily of colubrids, and even of all snakes. Many of the most commonly known snakes are members of this subfamily, including rat snakes, king snakes, milk snakes, vine snakes, and indigo snakes.
