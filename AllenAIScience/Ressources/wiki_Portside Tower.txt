Portside is a 139 metre tall building in Cape Town, South Africa. Completed in 2014, it is the city's tallest building and is Cape Town's first significant skyscraper developed in the central business district (CBD) in 15 years. The building is jointly owned by FirstRand Bank (FNB, RMB, Wesbank and Ashburton) and Old Mutual. The bank will self-occupy while Old Mutual will be renting office space to premium customers.


== Conception ==
In 2008 it was initially proposed that the building include a hotel and be 147.6m above sea level. However due to the Late-2000s recession and difficulties around securing a hotel management contact the project was put on hold for almost three years and the design was altered.
During the design and planning phase, and after extensive public participation, it is was decided to keep the building below a certain height so as not to obscure the view of Table Mountain. The tower will have over 51,500 m2 of office space with remaining space being used for over 1,382 parking bays and retail outlets.
The building was designed to use low energy technology throughout and is the first large building in South Africa to use almost exclusively LED Lighting. The building has been awarded a five star Green Star rating from the Green Building Council of South Africa as compliant technologies have been specified throughout.


== Construction ==

Construction work on the tower began on the 12 August 2011. In late March 2013 construction was temporarily halted by the City of Cape Town's disaster response unit due to strong gale force winds making the scaffolding unstable.
