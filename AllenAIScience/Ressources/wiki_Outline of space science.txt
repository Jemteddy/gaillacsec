The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to space science:
Space science – study of everything in outer space. This has sometimes been called astronomy, but recently astronomy has come to be regarded as a division of broader space science, which has grown to include other related fields, such as studying issues related to space travel and space exploration (including space medicine), space archaeology and science performed in outer space (see space research).


== Branches of space science ==

Astronomy
Fields of astronomy defined by approach
Observational astronomy – Observatories on the ground as well as space observatories take measurements of celestial entities and phenomena
Astrometry – studies the position and movements of celestial objects
Amateur astronomy

Theoretical astronomy – mathematical modelling of celestial entities and phenomena

Fields of astronomy defined by scope
Astrophysics – study of the physics of the universe; of extraterrestrial objects and interstitial spaces
Space plasma physics
Orbital mechanics or astrodynamics, which also has applications to spacecraft

Stellar astronomy – the study of stars
Solar astronomy – the study of our Sun

Planetary science – the study of planets, especially those other than Earth
Planetary geology

Galactic astronomy – the study of our Milky Way galaxy
Extragalactic astronomy – the study of the larger universe beyond the Milky Way
Physical cosmology – the study of the universe as a whole

Aerospace engineering
Astronautics


=== Space-related interdisciplinary fields ===
Astrobiology
Astrochemistry or cosmochemistry
Planetary science – overlaps with Earth science
Micro-g environment research
Forensic astronomy
Space archaeology – the study of human artifacts in outer space
Archaeoastronomy – the history of human understanding of the universe
