An environmental organization is an organization that seeks to protect, analyse or monitor the environment against misuse or degradation from human forces.
In this sense the environment may refer to the biophysical environment, the natural environment or the built environment. The organization may be a charity, a trust, a non-governmental organization or a government organization. Environmental organizations can be global, national, regional or local.
Some of the environmental issues that are of interest to environmental organizations are pollution, waste, resource depletion, human overpopulation and climate change.
Green politics is a political ideology which places a high importance on environmental goals and Green parties have formed to implement environmental policy at a government level.
