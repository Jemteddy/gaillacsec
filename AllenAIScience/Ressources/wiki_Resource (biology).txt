In Biology and Ecology, a resource is a substance or object in the environment required by an organism for normal growth, maintenance, and reproduction. Resources can be consumed by one organism and, as a result, become unavailable to another organism. For plants key resources are sunshine, nutrients, water, and place to grow. For animals key resources are food, water, and territory.


== Key resources for plants ==
Terrestrial plants require particular resources for photosynthesis and to complete their life cycle of germination, growth, reproduction, and dispersal:
Carbon dioxide
Microsite (ecology)
Nutrients
Photosynthetically active radiation
Pollination
Seed dispersal
Soil
Water


== Key resources for animals ==
Animals resources particular resources for metabolism and to complete their life cycle of gestation, birth, growth, and reproduction:
Foraging
Territory
Water


== Resources and ecological processes ==
Resource availability plays a central role in ecological processes:
Carrying capacity
Biological competition
Liebig's law of the minimum
Niche differentiation
