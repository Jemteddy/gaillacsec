Stellar physics, is a term coined for the research concerning the formation, evolution, interior and the atmospheres of stars. The understanding of the birth and death of stars requires the application of almost all branches of modern physics. These areas include; gravitation, hydrodynamics, atomic physics, liquid-solid state theory, superconductivity and superfluidity. This distinguishes it from stellar dynamics, which concerns mainly gravitational interactions between stars.
