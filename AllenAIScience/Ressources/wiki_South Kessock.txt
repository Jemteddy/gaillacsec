South Kessock is an area of the city of Inverness in Scotland.
It is to the north of Merkinch and is also known, somewhat disparagingly, as the Ferry. Prior to the construction of the Kessock Bridge, the Kessock Ferry sailed between North Kessock and here.

South Kessock has featured in two novels by Alex Mabon: The Lads from the Ferry and War of the Ferry. It is traditionally viewed as a working class area.

The area has a diverse set of wildlife habitats with a wide variety of plants and animals and as such was designated as a Local Nature Reserve in November 2007. Merkinch Local Nature Reserve is the 50th local nature reserve in Scotland and is the only one in the Highlands. The reserve consists of tidal pools, which are partially connected to the sea, open grassland and wooded areas. Habitats include salt marsh, fresh water marsh with reed beds, bog, scrub and wooded embankments.
