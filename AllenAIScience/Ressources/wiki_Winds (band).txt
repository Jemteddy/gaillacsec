Winds is a Norwegian neo-classical/progressive metal band formed in 1998. The music is largely influenced by classical music, with Andy Winter's piano work and Carl August Tidemann's guitar solos, often the central focuses. The lyrics are written by Andy Winter, and deal mostly with astral and existentialist philosophy.
