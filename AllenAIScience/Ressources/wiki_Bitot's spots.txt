Bitot's spots are the buildup of keratin located superficially in the conjunctiva, which are oval, triangular or irregular in shape. These spots are a sign of vitamin A deficiency and are associated with conjunctival xerosis. In 1863, Pierre Bitot (1822-1888), a French physician, first described these spots.
In ancient Egypt, this was treated with animal liver, which is where vitamin A is stored.
