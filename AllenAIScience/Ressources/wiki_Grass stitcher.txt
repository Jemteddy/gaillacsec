A grass stitcher is tool primarily used to repair and aerate lawns. Common goals include weed control by agitating the surface of the soil, loosening the soil, and preparing it prior to spreading grass seed. As a tool it is hand held and designed to be used while standing and have the spiked wheels pushed back and forth over the earth to be treated.
In some ways, grass stitchers are not dissimilar to garden cultivators. While cultivators till the soil by design, the grass stitcher actually prepares a seed bed ideal for sowing grass seed.
