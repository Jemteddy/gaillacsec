ESdat is environmental data management, analysis and reporting software for environmental and groundwater data. It is developed by Earth Science Information Systems (EScIS) based in Australia. Data is imported from a range of systems or data sources into a central environmental database, for data comparison, analysis, and reporting where it can be filtered and viewed in usable formats, such as tables, graphs, or on a map.
It is used by environmental consultants and site managers for contaminated and industrial sites, groundwater investigations, landfill and regulatory compliance.
ESdat is used to manage many types of environmental data including: laboratory chemistry data (QA data, lab sample planning and electronic Chain of Custody), field chemistry data (water, gas, soil), hydrogeological data (groundwater, borehole and well construction, lithological, geotechnical and stratigraphic, LNAPL), meteorological data (rain, wind, temperature), emission data (dust, HiVol, air quality, noise), logger data, surface water flows, and flora/fauna/pest/vegetation community data.
Data can be compared against Environmental Standards or site-specific trigger levels.
