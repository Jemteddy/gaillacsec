Pine Island Public Schools is a public school district in Pine Island, Minnesota, located in the heart of the town [1]. This school first started out in an old cabin in 1857 but was moved to its current location in 1864. All three schools, elementary, middle and high school, are located in one building with extra portable classrooms. The main mission statement for the school is "To provide a safe and challenging learning environment that prepares students for the future". With just a little over 1,200 [2] average students attending all three schools, it makes for get student teacher ratio. With a wide range of classes offered there is an opportunity to get a start in things you love.


== History ==
This land that the school stands on was donated by Moses Jewell and the brick building was put up costing $3000. There was an addition later that was known as the high school. The population from there had grown and the first graduation that took place was in 1887. "In the early 1990s – the flipping of pennies on school premises was strictly forbidden, and the use of the Lord’s Prayer in schools violated the Minnesota State Constitution." [3] For sports there was football, baseball, boys and girls basketball, the team was known as the "young tigers" that wore green and white uniforms. This was changed in 1925 and remain to this day; they are now the panthers and wear maroon and gold. In 1903 the state informed them that they needed to build a new high school, so that is what they did. There stands in the same spot a three story brick building. In the new gym the ceilings were too low to play basketball in, so games were played at the local Opera House than later on the 2nd floor of City Hall. In 1922 there was a problem because there was ninety-three students enrolled in the high school but there was a seating capacity of seventy-two. A year later physical education was required by state law. The kindergarten class was declared illegal because there was no normal department. [4] In 1932 there was the first junior-senior proms help in City Hall, which was decorated with a lot of paper and sweet peas. The school had then become overcrowded again, so they went to rebuild. Just as they were about to start it was struck by lightning was burned to the grown. There was a new building donated as a way to thank the tax payers. 1935 the band started up with just 8 instruments being used by 25 members. The hot lunch was introduced in 1938 being served a cocoa and hot thing. In 1940 the athletic fields were purchased for $1000 and new buses would take athletes around to games. Students in the '50s referred to the third floor as "7th heaven". The school went under many constructions in order to fit the climbing number of students finally in 1971 the school was basically finished. Today the number of students is raising and the school had to add portable classrooms in until we find a way to enhance the school.
