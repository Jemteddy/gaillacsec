Myology is the study of the muscular system, including the study of the structure, function, and diseases of muscle. The muscular system consists of skeletal muscle, which contracts to move or position parts of the body (e.g., the bones that articulate at joints), and smooth and cardiac muscle that propels, expels, or controls the flow of fluids and contained substance.
