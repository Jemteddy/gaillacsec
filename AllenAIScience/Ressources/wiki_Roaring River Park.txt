Roaring River Park is a heritage and nature park near Petersfield, Westmoreland Parish, Jamaica.
The park is on the site of the Roaring River Estate which belonged to the Beckford family: Peter Beckford, William Beckford.
The Roaring River runs underground, before appearing near to Petersfield, close to the Roaring River Cave, a series of limestone caverns with a small mineral spring inside. The Roaring River Citizens Association, a local community group, looks after the caves and provides guided tours for visitors. There is also a fresh water sinkhole where visitors can swim and a landscaped private garden where visitors are welcome for a contribution.
The river provides the parish capital, Savanna-la-Mar, with its water supply and it is the most important source of water in central Westmoreland and the Georges plain.
