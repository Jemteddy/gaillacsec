Because of its size and range of latitude, topography, and climate, India is home to a great diversity of ecoregions, ranging from permanent ice and snow to tropical rainforests. For Regions, see List of regions of India, for Climatic Regions see Climatic regions of India.
The Himalaya, which runs across India's northern tier, is the boundary between two of the Earth's great ecozones â€” the Palearctic, which covers most of temperate-to-arctic Eurasia, and Indomalaya, which covers most of the Indian subcontinent and extends into Indochina, Sundaland (Malaysia and western Indonesia) and the Philippines.
