CKXD-FM is a Canadian radio station broadcasting from Gander at 98.7 MHz FM. The station launched between 1973 and 1974 as CJCR at 1350 kHz AM, and is currently owned by Newcap Broadcasting. In 1977, after Don Jamieson bought out Geoff Stirling's interest in Radio CJYQ-930 Ltd., CJCR was renamed CFYQ. In 1983, Jamieson sold his company to CHUM Limited. In 1989, CHUM Limited sold the "Q" stations to Newcap. By 1990, CFYQ had changed frequencies from 1350 to 1010. In 1990, CFYQ's program feed changed from CJYQ to CKIX and changed its call letters again to CKXD. In 1999, with the AM equipment nearing the end of its life cycle, CKXD jumped from AM to 98.7 FM. In the early 2000s, CKXD re-branded from KIXX Country to Magic 98, and shortly afterwards to 98.7 K-ROCK. The other two KIXX Country stations outside of St. John's, CKXG in Grand Falls-Windsor and CKXX in Corner Brook, were also branded with the "Magic" name and then subsequently to K-ROCK.
CKXD had a repeater at 670 AM in Musgravetown (CKXB, originally CJNW in 1975 then CHYQ in 1977) serving Clarenville and the Bonavista Peninsula, but because of problems with the aging transmission equipment that resulted in many breakdowns, that transmitter was shut down in 2003. That area is now served by 97.5 K-ROCK in St. John's using the repeater in Clarenville at 100.7 FM.
