The Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame is an American baseball hall of fame which honors players, managers, and executives of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). It was created by the Helms Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles in 1942 to honor those individuals who made significant contributions to the league's ideals. The Hall of Fame inducted its first class in 1943. A special Hall of Fame room was set up at Los Angeles' Wrigley Field on June 27, 1943.
After the 1957 death of founder and main supporter Paul Helms and the arrival of Major League Baseball in the PCL's two largest markets, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the Hall went dormant. In 2003, with the Pacific Coast League celebrating its centennial season, the Hall was revived. In its first new induction in 2003, twenty-one pre-1957 inductees were elected. The aim of the PCL's Hall of Fame Committee is to eventually recognize worthy players from before 1957, as well as those who made more recent contributions to the league. As of 2015, 103 individuals have been inducted into the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame.
