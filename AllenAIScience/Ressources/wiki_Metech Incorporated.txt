For over forty years, Metech Recycling has provided secure and environmentally responsible electronics recycling and asset recovery services. Metech Recycling is a Founder and Certified e-Stewards recycler of the Basel Action Network (BAN). Metech Recycling resulted from the merger of Metech International and Guaranteed Recycling Xperts in 2009.
With the rapid expansion of technology, electronics such as mobile devices, laptops, computers, servers, routers, monitors, televisions, and printers are continually being replaced, creating a vast amount of e-waste each year. These discarded electronics often end up in landfills or are exported to countries with little to no environmental or pollution regulations, which can have a major environmental impact in our communities, and in other areas of the world. Many of the materials found in electronic devices are extremely hazardous. This includes lead, mercury, and cadmium. When mishandled, these devices can release toxins into the soil and/or atmosphere. In addition to the environmental concerns, many devices contain personal information, creating another means in which your identity can be stolen.
Metech Recycling encourages you to collect your old electronics and recycle them responsibly.
