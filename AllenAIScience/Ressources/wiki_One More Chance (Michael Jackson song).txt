== Curiosities ==
Jackson had already done two other songs called "One More Chance" with the Jackson 5 on the ABC album and with The Jacksons on the Victory album. Victory album version was written and performed (lead vocals) by younger brother Randy Jackson. Janet Jackson also made a version of the song on the album Victory in his single "If" as a B-side.


== Music video ==
Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch was raided by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office, investigating child molestation allegations made against the singer, which resulted in the 2005 criminal trial and subsequent acquittal of Jackson on all charges. Jackson had been shooting the video late into the night of November 17, 2003, but following the raid, production was stopped. The music video was directed by Nicholas Brandt. The single was instead promoted using a montage video of highlights from Jackson's career to date.
On October 13, 2010, the official website of Michael Jackson announced that the music video would be released in a deluxe DVD box set Michael Jackson's Vision on November 22, 2010. A rough 2 minute cut of the video leaked online on November 15, 2010. On November 19, 2010, the full length of the video premiered on Jackson's official website. As with the song being the last brand new single released during his lifetime, the music video is also Jackson's last music video and the first with new footage to be released posthumously. The video begins with a group of people walking onto a stage. The curtain opens to reveal a cafe that Jackson starts dancing in with the group of people watching. The lack of closeups on Jackson's face is a result of scheduling conflicts that were brought about by the raid.
