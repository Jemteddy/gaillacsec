Oxidative decarboxylation reactions are oxidation reactions in which a carboxylate group is removed, forming carbon dioxide. They often occur in biological systems: there are many examples in the citric acid cycle.


== The citric acid cycle ==
In the citric acid cycle pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase catalyze oxidative decarboxylation reactions. Each reaction reduces NAD+ to NADH and generates CO2.


== Other occurrences ==
The transformation of glyoxylate to formic acid is also an oxidative decarboxylation.
