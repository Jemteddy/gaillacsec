The Thomas Edison Depot Museum is located underneath the Blue Water Bridge connecting Port Huron, Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. The depot is owned and operated by the Port Huron Museum and is the actual depot that inventor Thomas Edison worked out of as a news butcher between 1859 and 1863. The museum includes a restored baggage car resting on a short spur of railroad track.
