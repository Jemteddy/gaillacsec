Mexico's Federal Highway 1D is a mostly tolled federal highway in the state of Baja California. It is precisely 98.17 km (61.00 mi) long. Between Avenida Mar Báltico (Baltic Sea Avenue) and the northern terminus, it is locally known as Segunda Benito Juárez. The rest of Highway 1D is locally known as tolled Autopista Escenica Tijuana-Ensenada (Tijuana-Ensenada scenic highway). Highway 1D is a high-speed alternative to the neighboring Highway 1, as it is four lanes wide. Due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean, it is more scenic than Highway 1 between Tijuana and Ensenada.
