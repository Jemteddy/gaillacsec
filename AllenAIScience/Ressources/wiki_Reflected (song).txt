"Reflected" is the first single by the rock band Alice Cooper, released in 1969 from the album Pretties for You.
The band also performed the song during a party scene in the film Diary of a Mad Housewife (1970).
The song received no chart performance and had no success, but was re-written in 1972 as "Elected", which is the band's second most successful single (the first being "School's Out"). The lyrics and melody of "Reflected" and "Elected" are unmistakably similar.
The single was issued twice; both on 7-inch vinyl. Its first release was on May 19, 1969, several months before the album it was originally featured on, Pretties for You, was released.
It featured a B-Side, "Living", which also appeared on the Pretties for You album.
