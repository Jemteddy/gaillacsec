The Bushongo are an ethnic group from the Congo River and surrounding areas. The creation god(or chembe) in Bushongo mythology is called Bumba. He existed alone in darkness, the world consisting only of water. The god Bumba was said to appear like a gigantic man in form and white in color. The creation took place when he vomited forth the sun, moon, earth, plants and animals, and then humanity. Bomazi is the ancestor-god of the Bushongo.
