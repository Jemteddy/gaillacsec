The 15 cm Mörser M 80 was a heavy howitzer used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It had a bronze barrel and was intended for siege work, although it had carriages suitable for both field and siege duties. The siege carriage was a steel sledge-type and was equipped with a hydraulic braking device to help absorb the recoil forces. Two wheels could be attached to the front of the carriage and a limber attached to the rear for transport. The field carriage relied on chock blocks and a rope brake device to absorb the gun's recoil.
The howitzer could only be loaded at low elevations.
