In the U.S. commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a borough is a self-governing municipal entity that is usually smaller than a city. There are 958 boroughs in Pennsylvania. The alternative spelling "boro" is sometimes used, including official notation.
All municipalities in Pennsylvania are classified as either cities, boroughs, or townships. The only exception to this is the town of Bloomsburg, which is recognized by state government as the only incorporated town in Pennsylvania, and uses this distinction in its promotion. However, many home rule municipalities remain classified as boroughs or townships for certain purposes, although the state's Borough and Township Codes no longer apply to those communities.
