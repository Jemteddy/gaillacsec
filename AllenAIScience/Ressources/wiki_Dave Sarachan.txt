On December 17, 1997, Bruce Arena hired Sarachan as his assistant with D.C. United following Bob Bradley's departure from the team to become the head coach of the Chicago Fire. Although Arena would leave following the 1998 season to coach the United States national team, Sarachan stayed on, assisting new head coach Thomas Rongen.


=== National team ===
However, following the MLS Cup-winning 1999 season, Sarachan left to become a full-time assistant to Arena with the national team, where he would be very instrumental to the team's scouting and preparation for the 2002 World Cup. Sarachan's intimate knowledge of soccer and his personal relationships with the men on the team was a major contribution to the team's historic run in Korea.


=== Chicago Fire ===
Sarachan received his first professional head coaching opportunity soon after the United States' impressive World Cup run when, after the 2002 season Bob Bradley left Chicago for his hometown MetroStars. Sarachan was chosen for the Fire position, and had a tremendous first season, leading the Fire to the MLS Supporters' Shield with a 15-7-8 record, as well as a U.S. Open Cup victory, and an appearance in the MLS Cup, where they lost to the San Jose Earthquakes; for his performance as a rookie, Sarachan was named the MLS Coach of the Year. Since being named only the second coach in Fire history on Nov. 4, 2002, Sarachan guided the squad to its third Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup crown in 2003 in addition to appearances in MLS Cup 2003 and the 2004 Open Cup Final.
Sarachan's second year was significantly harder, however, as star defender Carlos Bocanegra left MLS for Fulham before the season began, and he lost national teamer DaMarcus Beasley to PSV Eindhoven in midseason; numerous other injuries plagued the team, and the Fire ended the season tied for the league's worst record, at 8-13-9. The Fire finished at 15-13-4 in 2005. In Sarachan's fourth season, the Chicago Fire took their fourth Lamar Hunt Open Cup. The Fire's appearance in MLS Cup 2003 led to an invite to the 2004 CONCACAF Champions Cup, during which Chicago registered a combined 2-2-0 record against San Juan Jabloteh of Trinidad & Tobago (quarterfinals) and Costa Rican powerhouse Deportivo Saprissa (semifinals).
On June 20, 2007, Sarachan was fired as head coach, by Fire GM John Guppy.[3] Sarachan finished with a 55-50-31 league record with the Fire and 75-57-33 across all competitions.

Sarachan was hired by the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2008 along with current head coach Bruce Arena. The two of them led the Galaxy in the second half of the 2008 season when there was really no chance of the team making the playoffs. In 2009 the turnaround was made, Sarachan and Arena brought in 16 new players and the Galaxy cut their goals against deficit in almost half and was in first place for much of the season. They eventually led the Galaxy to MLS Cup 2009 where they eventually lost to Real Salt Lake on penalty kicks.
Sarachan currently lives in Southern California with his wife, Cherie and two children, Ian and Alexa.
