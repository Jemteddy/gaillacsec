HP Lyrae is a star in the constellation Lyra. First noted to be variable in 1935 by Otto Morgenroth of the Sonneberg Observatory, it is a post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star that varies by 0.5 magnitude over a period of 70.4 days. The reason for its variability is still a mystery: first catalogued as an eclipsing binary and presumed to be a pair of stars of spectral type A6, however its light curve is consistent with that of an RV Tauri variable in 2002, leading to Graczyk and colleagues to classify it as such in 2002. Calculating its surface temperature at 7700 K, they concluded it was the hottest such variable discovered.
