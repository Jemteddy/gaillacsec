An LED Filament light bulb is an electric light bulb which produces light with a LED that is shaped as a filament. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.
The LED filament is composed of a series of LEDs on a transparent substrate, referred to as Chip-On-Glass (COG). These transparent substrates are made of glass or sapphire materials. This transparency allows the emitted light to disperse evenly and uniformly without any interference. The COG material is then coated with an even coating of Phosphor material. 
Compared to other LED lights, LED Filament lights are omni-directional. The filament comprises a strip of LEDs that are set in a fluorescent compound.
