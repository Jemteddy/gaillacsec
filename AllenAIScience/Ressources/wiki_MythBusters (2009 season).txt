Based on Geoffrey Pyke's proposed project of building an aircraft carrier out of pykrete during World War II (it wasn't put into practice because the war ended), the MythBusters decided to test the viability of making a pykrete boat.
In additional footage shown on the MythBusters website, two additional tests were shown.
Blocks of ice and regular pykrete were placed on nails against a board at room temperature. The ice melted significantly faster than the pykrete.
A "shock test" was performed on the three materials by dropping a block of each approximately six feet onto the ground. The block of ice shattered into many pieces. The block of regular pykrete broke into two pieces, but did not shatter. The block of pseudo-pykrete would not break, even when slammed down from the same height.
