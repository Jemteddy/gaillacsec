The Bohai Economic Rim (BER) or Bohai Bay Economic Rim is the economic hinterland surrounding Beijing and Tianjin. It also includes areas in Hebei, Liaoning and Shandong which surrounds the Bohai Sea. This region has gone through major changes in economic and infrastructures. This emerging region is rising as a Northern economic power house and rivals the Pearl River Delta in the south and the Yangtze River Delta in the east.


== Economy ==
The Bohai Economic Rim has traditionally been involved in heavy industries and manufacturing. Tianjin's strengths have always been in aviation, logistics and shipping. Beijing complements this with strong petrochemical, education and R&D industries. The area is becoming a significant growth cluster for the automobile, electronics, petrochemical sectors, especially with Shenyang's automotive industry, software and aircraft, Dalian attracting foreign investments in manufacturing and Qingdao for its health services.
The Chinese central government has made it a priority to integrate all the cities in the Bohai Bay rim and foster economic development. This includes building an advanced communications network, better highways, increased education and scientific resources as well as tapping natural resources off the Bohai rim.
In recent decades, petroleum and natural gas deposits have been discovered in Bo Hai.

=== Rail ===
Since 2000, there have been rapid infrastructure developments within the Bohai Economic Rim. Rail projects of varied natures have been built, including high-speed inter-city rail, metros and suburban rail.


==== High-speed rail ====
In 2006, the Chinese government had plans to construct 710 kilometres (440 mi) of high-speed railway in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region by 2020.
In August 2008, the Beijing–Tianjin Intercity Railway opened providing a direct route between Beijing and Tianjin. The initial trains run on average 300 km/h and have cut journey times between the two municipalities to half an hour. Also under construction is the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway, which will connect the Bohai Economic Rim to the Yangtze River Delta.


==== Light rail ====
Tianjin Tram
Dalian Tram


==== Metros ====
Binhai Mass Transit
Beijing Metro
Shenyang Metro
Tianjin Metro
Dalian Metro
Qingdao Metro (under construction)


==== Suburban railway ====

== Geography ==
The gulf is formed by the Liaodong Peninsula to the northeast and the Shandong Peninsula to the south. Bo Hai consists of three bays: Laizhou Bay to the south, Liaodong Bay to the north, and Bohai Wan to the west. The rivers Huang He, Liao He, Hai He and Luan River empty into Bo Hai.
The Bohai economic rim includes Beijing, Tianjin, part of Hebei province, part of Liaoning province, and part of Shandong province. List of major cities or ports in these municipalities and provinces are listed below:

== Pollution ==
A Xinhua News Agency report in February, 2007, states: “Effluent has turned the sea a dark red and given it an acrid stench at Guanxi’s Silver Beach, a national tourist attraction. Local staff say it is not the first time this has happened – sometimes it occurs every few days. They blame the run-off from nearby shellfish processing plants.” 


=== Jiaozhou Bay-Laizhou Bay Canal ===
In April 2004, an official of the Shandong province raised the possibility of constructing a canal between Jiaozhou Bay and Laizhou Bay as a means of easing the pollution problem in the Bo Hai. The proposed canal will also be open to ships traveling between Bo Hai and the Yellow Sea. A meeting held in Qingdao in October, 2006, was attended by more than a hundred members of academia.
