Patinopecten yessoensis (Yesso scallop, Giant Ezo scallop, Ezo giant scallop) is a species of scallop. Its name Yesso/Ezo refers to its being found north of Japan. They are marine bivalve mollusks in the family Pectinidae, the scallops.
This species is found around the far eastern Asian coast, from China, Korea, Japan and Sakhalin, and possibly as far north as the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands. It is aquafarmed (see Scallop aquaculture) in China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia, with over 1,400,000 t worth over US$373 million harvested in 2007.
Its tissues bioaccumulate algal yessotoxins, which are studied extensively.
