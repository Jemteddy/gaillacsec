An engine power plant is a power station in which power comes from the combination of a reciprocating engine and an alternator. Thanks to very short start-up time, Engine power plants can provide full output within few minutes (high flexibility) and ensure load balancing. The latter becomes more and more challenging and important when power supply variations are increasing due to rising shares of intermittent renewable energy sources in many countries around the world.
