The granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor also known as CD116 (Cluster of Differentiation 116), is a receptor for granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which stimulates the production of white blood cells. The receptor is normally located on myeloblast, mature neutrophil, but not on any erythroid or megakaryocytic lineage cells.
It is associated with Surfactant metabolism dysfunction type 4.


== Structure ==
The granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor is a heterodimer composed of at least two different subunits; an α chain, and a β chain which is also present in the receptors for IL-3 and IL-5. The α subunit contains a binding site for granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The β chain is involved in signal transduction. Association of the α and β subunits results in receptor activation.


== Signal transduction ==
Upon dimerisation of the α and β subunits the β subunit becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family. This leads to association with a Shc adaptor protein. Then Shc interacts with GRB2/SoS complex which results in activation of more downstream molecules in the pathway.
