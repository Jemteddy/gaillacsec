"Nadlik Beyakhad Ner (Light a Candle)" (Hebrew script: נדליק ביחד נר, sometimes translated as "We'll Light a Candle Together") was the Israeli entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002, performed in Hebrew and English by Sarit Hadad.
The song is a ballad, with Hadad exhorting her listeners to join her in lighting candles, in order to shine light into the darkness of fear and hopelessness.
The song was tenth in order of performance, following Macedonia's Karolina with "Od nas zavisi" and preceding Switzerland's Francine Jordi with "Dans le jardin de mon âme". At the close of voting, it had received 37 points, placing 12th in a field of 24.
It was succeeded as Israeli representative at the 2003 Contest by Lior Narkis with "Words for Love".
