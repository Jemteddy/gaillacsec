Cheez-It is a cracker manufactured by the Kellogg Company through the Sunshine Biscuits division. They are roughly 26 by 24 mm (1.0 by 0.95 inch) rectangular crackers made with wheat flour, vegetable oil, sharp cheddar cheese, salt, and spices. The product was introduced in 1921 by the Green and Green company of Dayton Ohio; a series of corporate acquisitions made Cheez-It the property of the Keebler Company in 1996, of which Sunshine Brands is a lower division. Keebler, in turn, was acquired by the Kellogg Company in 2001.
