Chorology (from Greek χῶρος, khōros, "place, space"; and -λογία, -logia) can mean
the study of the causal relations between geographical phenomena occurring within a particular region
the study of the spatial distribution of organisms.

The goal of the chorological point of view is to know the character of regions and places through comprehension of the existence together and interrelations among different realms of reality and their varied manifestations, and to comprehend the earth surface as a whole in its actual arrangement in continents, larger and smaller regions, and places.Alfred Hettner

In geography, the term was first used by Strabo. In the twentieth century, Richard Hartshorne worked on that notion again. The term was popularized by Ferdinand von Richthofen.
