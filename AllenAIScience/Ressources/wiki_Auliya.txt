Auliya (awlia) is an Arabic word usually translated as friend, helper, supporter, patron or protector. It's often used to designate the status of a saint. For example, the famous Nizamuddin Auliya became known as such after his religious contributions. One of his sayings also demonstrates the use of the word Auliya to designate sainthood: "The love of Auliya (saints) is stronger than their reason." In Indonesia, 'Auliya' is a common given name.
"Verily! On the Friends of Allah, there is no fear, nor shall they grieve." (10, 62 -Quran [1]
In Islamic mysticism Auliya(s) are chosen friends of Allah. They spend their lifetime in purifying their inner selves to attain nearness to Allah to whom they have given their selves. Their desire is only their Creator and they do not depend upon others.
