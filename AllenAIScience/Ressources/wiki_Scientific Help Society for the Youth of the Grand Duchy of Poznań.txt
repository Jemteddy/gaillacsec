Scientific Help Society for the Youth of the Grand Duchy of Poznań (Polish: Towarzystwo Naukowej Pomocy dla Młodzieży Wielkiego Księstwa Poznańskiego) was a social-educational society established in Poznań in 1841 by Karol Marcinkowski and Maciej Mielzynski. It was the first institution in the Polish lands offering scholarship premiums for the talented but poor young people of Polish origin in the Polish areas under Prussian/German domination (Greater Poland, Pomerania, Silesia but especially in the Grand Duchy of Poznań).
The society played a great role in preserving Polish language and culture in the German occupied areas of Poland and reverting the Germanisation policies. It was active until the outbreak of World War II in 1939.
