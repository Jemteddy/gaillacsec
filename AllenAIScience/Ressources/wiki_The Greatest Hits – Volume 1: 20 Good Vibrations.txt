The Greatest Hits – Volume 1: 20 Good Vibrations is a 1995 single disc compilation by the Beach Boys and released through Capitol Records. In 1999, after it was certified 2x platinum by the RIAA it was decided to create sequels to the original collection, so the release was updated accordingly to reflect this change. The updated version was re-issued on September 21, 1999, the same day that its sequel, The Greatest Hits – Volume 2: 20 More Good Vibrations appeared. The variation to the 1995 issue and the 1999 issue are the versions chosen for "Be True to Your School" and "Help Me, Rhonda". The 1995 issue features the album version of both while the 1999 issue features the single version.
Featuring most of their classic—and biggest—hits during The Beach Boys' 1962-1966 golden streak, the album only breaks the period production by including the 1988 number 1 hit, "Kokomo".
The Greatest Hits – Volume 1: 20 Good Vibrations is also notable for crediting Murry Wilson, not Nick Venet, as producer of "Surfin' Safari" and "409", while also modifying "Surfin' U.S.A." and "Shut Down"'s credits to reflect Brian Wilson as producer.
Released in September 1999, The Greatest Hits – Volume 1: 20 Good Vibrations charted at number 95 US in March 2000 after a less-than-accurate Beach Boys ABC-TV movie was transmitted.
