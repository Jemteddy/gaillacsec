Open peer review denotes several, closely related forms of scholarly peer review:
open-identity or attributed peer review (as opposed to anonymous peer review);
open-access or disclosed peer review, where the peer review contents are publicized;
open-invitation or unsolicited peer review, where anyone interested can join and contribute to the peer review process. In this case does not follow that peer-review is a gate-keeping process.

Related terminology is "public peer review", "transparent peer review", and "advanced open peer review".
