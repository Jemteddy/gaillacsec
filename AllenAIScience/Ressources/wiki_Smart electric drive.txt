The Smart Fortwo electric drive, or smart ed, is a battery electric vehicle variant of the Smart Fortwo city car, formerly marketed as the Smart Fortwo EV. Field testing began in London with 100 units in 2007. The second generation was introduced in 2009 and was available in 18 markets around the world for leasing or through the Car2Go carsharing service in selected cities, with over 2,300 units delivered. A near production version was unveiled at the September 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show.
Deliveries of the third generation Smart began in the U.S. and Europe from May 2013, and Smart plans to mass-produce the electric car with availability in 30 markets worldwide. More than 8,800 units of the second and third generation Smart ED have been sold in North America and Europe between 2009 and June 2014, of which, over 6,500 units are third generation variants.

Top speed: 120 kilometres per hour (75 miles per hour)


== Second generation ==
The second generation was introduced in 2009 to 18 markets with the objective to gather experience about how customers use and charge electric vehicles. Daimler initially planned to build 1,000 vehicles, but as demand exceeded the company’s expectations, more than 2,000 Smart Fortwo electric drive cars were produced. The electric cars were available for leasing or through the Car2Go carsharing service in San Diego, Amsterdam and Vancouver. Production of the second-generation Smart Fortwo electric drive began in November 2009 in Smartville, Hambach, France. The Smart EDs have a lithium-ion battery provided by Tesla Motors with capacity of 14 kilowatt-hours (50 MJ). The range of a fully charged battery is up to 135 kilometres (84 miles) under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) cycle.

As part of a three-phase roll-out program, phase two began with field testing in Berlin in December 2009 with 100 units out of 300 that will be deploy in Germany. For phase two 1,500 cars were produced, and field tested in Hamburg, Paris, Rome, Milan, Pisa, London, the English Midlands, Madrid, Zurich, Portugal, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands during the first half of 2010. In October 2010, 250 units were made available for field testing in several cities in the United States. Testing also was conducted in Canada; and in 2011 in selected markets in Asia.

Phase three of the program is mass production, which was scheduled to begin with the 2012 model year. In the United States sales were scheduled to begin in 2012 with the 2013 model year. On July 2011 an agreement was reached between Daimler AG and Robert Bosch GmbH to develop and produce innovative traction motors for electric vehicles. Based on this joint venture, Daimler planned to use the improved traction motors with the new generation of Smart electric drive cars scheduled to go on sale in 2012.


=== Specifications ===
Power: 20 kW (27 hp) continuous; peak power output of 30 kW (40 hp) for approximately 2 minutes
Torque: 120 newton metres (89 lbf·ft)
Battery capacity: 16.5 kW·h lithium-ion battery
Economy: 12 kW·h/100 km, also reported to be 200 W·h/mi
Range: 135 kilometres (84 miles) on the (NEDC cycle)
Top speed: 100 kilometres per hour (62 miles per hour)
The lithium-ion battery pack takes three hours to charge from 20 to 80 percent of its capacity with a standard 220 V outlet. It can also be charged using a common US household 110 V outlet. The car has a 3.3 kW on-board charger for this "level 1 and 2" charging. Smart claims a 0-to-60 kilometres per hour (37 mph) time of 6.5 seconds, the same as for the gasoline version. It has a single fixed-gear ratio transmission and is about 308 lb (140 kg) heavier than a gasoline-powered Fortwo.


=== Markets and sales ===
Over 2,300 units of the second generation models were leased between 2009 and October 2012 in 18 markets around the world. Of these, 1,721 units were registered in Europe through October 2012, and 527 units in the U.S. through December 2012.


==== United States ====
The trial program in the US began in January 2011 with the first customer delivery in Washington, DC. A total of 250 units were made available for leasing at a price of US$599 per month for a period of 48 months and 60,000 kilometres (37,282 mi), plus US$2,500 due at signing. This pricing is before taxes or any government tax credits or rebates available. The limited fleet of second-generation Smart Fortwo electric drive cars was introduced first in Portland, Oregon, Los Angeles, San Jose, California, Orlando, Florida, Austin, Detroit, Indianapolis and the Interstate 95 corridor between Washington, D.C. and Boston, including New Jersey and New York.

In July 2011, Car2Go announced the deployment of a fleet of Smart EDs into carsharing service in San Diego before the end of 2011. The company stated that the carsharing electric cars will have a range of 84 miles (135 km), and, based on their experience with usage in other cities, they will most likely need to be recharged every two or three days. When reserving the electric car online, San Diego Car2Go members are able to see the battery's state of charge, so if the customer wants to go for an extended drive, the option is available to find the right car for that trip.

In November 2011 fleets of 300 Smart EDs each were deployed in San Diego and Amsterdam as part of the Car2Go service. As of December 2012, a total of 527 Smart EDs were registered in the US since January 2011, including 300 units deployed for Car2Go in San Diego.
Considering an energy consumption of 39 kilowatt-hours per 100 miles (878 kJ/km) and a conversion factor of 33.7 kW·h of electricity being the energy equivalent of a US gallon of gasoline (32 kiljoules to the litre), the US Environmental Protection Agency officially rated the Smart ED combined fuel economy at 87 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (mpg-e) (2.7 L gasoline equivalent/100 km; 104 mpg-imp gasoline equivalent), 94 mpg-US (2.5 L/100 km; 113 mpg-imp) city and 79 mpg-US (3.0 L/100 km; 95 mpg-imp) highway. EPA's official all-electric range is 63 miles (101 km), but in favorable conditions in an urban environment at warm temperatures the carmaker claims the Smart Fortwo ED can reach up to 98 miles (158 km). According to Forbes, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy ranked the Smart ForTwo Electric Drive the "greenest" car for 2014.


==== France ====
A total of 152 Smart EDs were registered in France since 2010 through December 2012.


== Third generation ==
The third-generation Smart electric drive was unveiled at the September 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show. Key differences with the second-generation model include a more powerful electric motor, which improves acceleration and top speed; a new lithium-ion battery pack that will allow to increase the range to 140 kilometres (87 mi) and an option for quick-charge will be available; and other features include an enlarged grille opening, stylish LED daytime running lights, wider door sills, some minor modifications to the rear, fully automatic air conditioning with pollen filter and pre-air conditioning. Several features will be controlled remotely through a smart drive application for the iPhone.

In Germany the Smart ED will be available for €16,000 (around US$22,400) plus a monthly fee of €60 (US$84) for the battery rental. Online reservations are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter 2011. In the US pricing will start at Price US$25,750 and Price US$28,750 for the Soft Top Cabriolet before any applicable government incentives. Canadian pricing for the Electric Drive starts at CA$26,990 and the cabriolet version starts at CA$29,990.
The third-generation Smart electric drive was released in the US in May 2013 with 60 units delivered that month. Sales in Europe also began in May 2013. Smart plans to mass-produce the electric car with availability in 30 markets worldwide.
In February 2014, Smart announced it would be offering the 2014 model year nationwide, not just in the CARB states as the 2013 model year was.


=== Markets and sales ===
Global sales of the third generation model reached 4,130 units during 2013. The Smart ED was the top selling plug-in electric car in Germany in 2013, with 2,146 units registered through December 2013, representing 32% of the 6,711 Smarts sold in the country. After the German market, European sales were led by France, with 478 units registered through December 2013. U.S. sales totaled 923 units through December 2013.
Global cumulative sales of the third generation variant reached 6,514 units up to June 2014, while combined sales of second and third generation reached 8,814 units as of June 2014. As of June 2014, combined sales of both generations reached 3,959 units in Germany, 2,542 units in the U.S. and 865 units in France.
