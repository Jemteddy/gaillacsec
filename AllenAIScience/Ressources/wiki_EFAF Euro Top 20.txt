The EFAF Euro Top 20 is the official EFAF ranking system for American Football club teams in Europe.
The list considers only those teams playing in an EFAF member country, and competing in one of the official EFAF international competitions (European Football League, EFAF Cup, EFAF Challenge Cup or EFAF Atlantic Cup).
The list is updated after every weekend of European competition, or at least every two weeks, during the EFAF competition period of April to July.
