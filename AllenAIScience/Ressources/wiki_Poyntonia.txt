Poyntonia, is a monotypic frog genus in the Pyxicephalidae family. It is also known under common names reserve frogs and marsh frogs.
The sole member of the genus, Poyntonia paludicola (common names: montane marsh frog, Kogelberg reserve frog), is endemic to the Western Cape province, South Africa. It has been recorded in the Kogelberg, Hottentots-Holland, and Klein River mountains at the elevations of 200–1,800 m (660–5,910 ft) asl. Even though its range is very restricted and in four separate locations, it is relatively common where it occurs. It is possible that the separate populations represent cryptic species, but this has not yet been studied.
Poyntonia paludicola inhabit montane fynbos (Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation) in areas with high rainfall (2,000-3,000 mm per year). These frogs breed in shallow streams and seepages. The populations are believed to be stable but the populations are potentially threatened by habitat change caused by alien species, dam construction, and fires. All known populations are in protected areas, Kogelberg Biosphere Nature Reserve, Hottentots Holland Nature Reserve, and Fernkloof Nature Reserve.
Poyntonia paludicola are small frogs, measuring 23–30 mm (0.91–1.18 in) in snout–vent length. They strongly resemble bufonids with their rough and warty skin on sides and dorsal surfaces of adults. It is suspected that breeding may occur at any time of the year, whenever environmental conditions allow. Male advertisement call is unique, coarse "kruck-kruck-kruck".
