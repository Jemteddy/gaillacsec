Sibling-in-law is a gender-neutral term to refer to a brother-in-law or sister-in-law.
A brother-in-law (plural brothers-in-law) is the brother of one's spouse or the husband of one's sibling.
A sister-in-law (plural sisters-in-law) is the sister of one's spouse or the wife of one's sibling.
Additionally, persons who have married siblings will refer to each other as "brother/sister-in-law" or "co-brother/sister-in-law" since each is the sibling-in-law of the other's spouse.
