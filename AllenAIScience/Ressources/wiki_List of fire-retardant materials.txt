Fire retardant materials should not be confused with fire resistant materials. Whilst a fire resistant material is one that is designed to resist burning and withstand heat, fire retardant materials are designed to burn slowly. An example of a fire resistant materials is one which is used in bunker gear worn by firefighters to protect them from the flames of a burning building. In the United Kingdom, after two significant construction fires which resulted in a combined loss of Â£150 million, The Joint Code of Practice was introduced by the national fire safety organisation, FPA, to prevent fires on buildings undergoing construction work. The Joint Code of Practice provides advice on how to prevent fires such as the use of flame retardant temporary protection materials such as some high quality floor protectors which are designed to burn slowly and prevent the spread of fires.
