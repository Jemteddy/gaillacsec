Photo-erosion is the dispersion of the outer layers of a prestellar core by the ionizing radiation of a nearby star.
This erosion prevents the accretion of these outer layers around the protostar at the centre of the core; and this, in turn, prevents the protostar from becoming a fully-fledged star. The protostar instead becomes a brown dwarf or planetary-mass object.
