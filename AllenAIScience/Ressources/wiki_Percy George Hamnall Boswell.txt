Professor Percy George Hamnall Boswell FRS (1886â€“1960) was a British geologist. He was Professor of Geology at Liverpool University and Head of the Department of Geology at the Imperial College of Science, London. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May, 1931. In 1934 he visited Africa to validate Louis Leakey's claim that he had found fossil remains of Homo sapiens more than 100,000 years old and publicly disagreed with Leakey's conclusions.
