The Cypriot mouse (Mus cypriacus) is a species of mouse native to Cyprus. Its primary habitat seems to be the vineyards and fields of the Tro√∂dos Mountains region.
The mouse was recognized as a new species in 2004 by Thomas Cucchi, a research fellow at the University of Durham. It was formally described in 2006, in Zootaxa.
The Cypriot mouse has characteristics that distinguish it from European mice: bigger ears, eyes and teeth; DNA tests confirmed that it was a distinct species.
"All other endemic mammals of Mediterranean islands died out following the arrival of man, with the exception of two species of shrew. The new mouse of Cyprus is the only endemic rodent still alive, and as such can be considered as a living fossil," said Dr. Cucchi. Originally, Dr. Cucchi wanted to call it Mus aphrodite, as Cyprus is the birthplace of Aphrodite according to Greek mythology.
