Electric blue is a color close to cyan that is a representation of the color of lightning, an electric spark, and argon sign (including a small part of mercury)s; it is named after the ionized air glow produced during electrical discharges.
The first recorded use of electric blue as a color name in English was in 1845. The color electric blue (the version shown below as medium electric blue) was in vogue in the 1890s.

Panelology
In a 1998 retelling of the original 1963 story of Superman Red/Superman Blue, Superman is temporarily deprived of the solar energy needed to provide the energy his body required to give him powers and Superman develops electricity-based abilities, which eventually forces him to adopt a blue and white containment suit to prevent the energy from dispersing. While retaining most of his abilities, he could now also generate electric attacks rather than his original heat-vision. This version of Superman was referred to by some comic book fans as "Electric Blue Superman".
Physics
The electric blue glow of electricity results from the spectral emission of the excited ionized atoms (or excited molecules) of air (mostly oxygen and nitrogen) falling back to unexcited states, which happens to produce an abundance of electric blue light. This is the reason electrical sparks in air, including lightning, appear electric blue. It is a coincidence that the color of Cherenkov radiation and light emitted by ionized air are a very similar blue despite their very different methods of production.
