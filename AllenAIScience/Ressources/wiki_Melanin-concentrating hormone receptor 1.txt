Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1, also known as MCH1, is one of the human melanin-concentrating hormone receptors.
The protein encoded by this gene, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family 1, is an integral plasma membrane protein which binds melanin-concentrating hormone. The encoded protein can inhibit cAMP accumulation and stimulate intracellular calcium flux, and is probably involved in the neuronal regulation of food consumption. Although structurally similar to somatostatin receptors, this protein does not seem to bind somatostatin.


== Function ==
MCH1 is thought to have a number of functions including in the regulation of appetite, and in stress, anxiety and depression.
