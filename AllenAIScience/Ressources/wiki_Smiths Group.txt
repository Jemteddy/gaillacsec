== S Smith & Sons ==
This watch chronometer and instrument makers business was established by Samuel Smith in London in 1851. Their premises were in The Strand and they were watchmakers to the Admiralty. Retailing and wholesaling of Smiths-branded motor accessories was added in 1904 when a Watford supplier turned out Smith's first speedometer—The Perfect Speed Indicator. Growth was fast. Smiths began to manufacture some of their own motor products particularly speedometers. From mid-1913 all motor accessories activities were carried out from handsome purpose-built premises at Speedometer House, 179-185 Great Portland Street ("Motor Row"). The premises in the Strand became a Lyons tearoom but jewellers establishments were retained at Trafalgar Square and 68 Piccadilly. By this time motor accessories production included Smiths multiple-jet carburettors (designed by Trier & Martin), lighting sets and electric starters, generators and the Smith's Auto-Clear mechanical horn.
The outbreak of war in 1914 led to the capture of markets around the world previously held by the German competition. By 1915 new War Office contracts for aeroplane accessories, lighting sets etc. and munitions required the speedy erection of a new freehold factory. The new factory, known as Cricklewood Works, was built at Cricklewood, north London. In 1921 Great Portland Street activities were moved to Cricklewood following 1920's purchase of the former Metallurgique works alongside their Cricklewood Works. Post World War I their accessories became standard fittings in new cars all provided by the manufacturer.

==== Automotive ====
At the start of the 20th century, the age of the early automobiles, Smith & Sons produced the first British odometer ("mileometer") and speedometer. In the 1930s Smiths agreed a trading deal with Lucas whereby the two would not compete in certain areas and Lucas took on part of Smiths non-instrumentation assets. Smiths became the dominant supplier of instruments to British motorcar and motorcycle firms.
These instruments carried a distinctive logo, the word "SMITHS" centred above the middle of the dial and silk screened onto it in a unique house font familiar to generations of drivers.

The car was profligate in the extreme and ... a constant target of vandalism in the city. Jessica refused to give up on it though and was always enchanted anew as she slid across the soft red leather, placing her hands on the large steering wheel and gazing at the wonderful old Smiths speedometer with its curiously distinctive dial.

The KLG Sparking Plug distribution rights were purchased from Kenelm Lee Guinness in 1919. The British Jaeger Instrument Company was purchased in 1927 as was the KLG Sparking Plug Company (Robinhood Engineering). The Jackall hydraulic jacking system was manufactured from 1935 by Smith's Jacking Systems and immediately became standard equipment in many popular cars. In 1937 a separate aircraft and marine department was created in the parent company and named Smiths Aircraft Instruments. It operated with Smiths subsidiary Henry Hughes and Son manufacturers of aircraft and marine instruments.

==== Aviation, marine and industrial ====
Separate Smiths Aviation and Smiths Marine divisions were set up in 1958. In 1960, an Industrial division was formed whose main operations were industrial instrumentation. With increasing diversification and international operations the name Smiths Industries Ltd. was adopted in 1965.


==== Caerbont Automotive Instruments ====
Clocks, watches, and automotive instruments eventually ceased to be significant markets for Smiths, and by the 1980s, the automotive instrument division had been sold, first to Lucas, and eventually to the factory employees. The new company, Caerbont Automotive Instruments, continues to produce classic Smiths-branded instruments with the blessing of Smiths Group plc.
