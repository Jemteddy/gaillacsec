A phonetic dictionary is a dictionary that allows you to locate words by the "way they sound", i.e. a dictionary that matches common or phonetic misspellings with the correct spelling of a word. Such a dictionary uses pronunciation respelling to aid the search for or recognition of a word.
This is different from a pronouncing dictionary, such as the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, which maps from a written word to its pronunciation in a chosen dialect.
