A science magazine is a periodical publication with news, opinions and reports about science for a non-expert audience. A periodical publication for scientific experts, in contrast, is called a "scientific journal". Science magazines are read by non-scientists and scientists who want accessible information on fields outside their specialization.
Articles in science magazines are sometimes republished or summarized by the general press.
