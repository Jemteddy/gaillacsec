GladRags is a company based in Portland, Oregon that produces reusable cloth menstrual pads.
GladRags was founded in 1993 by Brenda Mallory and Karen Paule. Mallory was inspired by reusable cloth diapers. Tracy Puhl has led the company since 2011. In 2013 Puhl was named Young Entrepreneur of the Year for Oregon and Southwest Washington by the U.S. Small Business Administration. GladRags is owned and operated by women. It is cruelty-free and certified as a B corporation.
GladRags' cloth pads are machine-washable and made from soft cotton flannel that folds and snaps around underwear. Each rag includes two insert pads and a thin cover and comes in various patterns and colors. They are made to last four to five years and are sometimes used in conjunction with menstrual cups. The company is the primary distributor of the Moon Cup brand of reusable silicone menstrual cups.
GladRags partners with a women-owned sewing company and Abilities at Work, an organization that provides vocational training and employment for adults with developmental disabilities.
