Sonar is a digital audio workstation created by Cakewalk.


== Notable features ==


=== Video and audio formats ===
Sonar's features include:
Modular ProChannel
Record and manipulate an amount of multitrack digital audio limited by hardware only
Record and manipulate MIDI data
Apply any DirectX special effects, such as reverberation and delay
Automate the process of mixing audio
Use virtual instruments, such as software: synthesizers, samplers, and drum machines
Connect to other multimedia applications via Rewire
Sonar Producer Edition includes a 64-bit mastering suite
Sonar provides limited facilities for video, surround sound (5.1, 7.1), and supports .avi, .mpeg, .wmv and .mov files. Sonar has the ability to show video as thumbnails contained in a separate track. With appropriate hardware, it is also possible to output the video to an external monitor screen via Firewire. Common SMPTE formats, frame sizes and frame rates are supported. It is possible to transfer audio loop files from other compatible software into sonar and complete a final mixdown.
Various audio export options (including 64-bit masters) are AIFF, AU, CAF, FLAC, RAW, SD2, W64 (Sony Wave-64), WAV (Microsoft)


=== Active Controller Technology ===
Active Controller Technology (ACT) is a feature that assists in the process of remapping parameters of MIDI controllers or surfaces. Having the ability to control effects and virtual instruments (See Software synthesizer), the controller/surface mappings for a given plug-in work the same on each instance of that plug-in, whenever that instance has focus. Sonar now fully supports the integrated Sonar V-Studio 700 automation suite, [3] which is a complete Sonar-dedicated automation console built by Cakewalk/Roland. (ref. Cakewalk (company))
Sonar also supports other dedicated special-purpose controllers/surfaces such as the CM Labs MotorMix. Sonar includes a general purpose plug-in, called ACT MIDI Controller, that can be configured to support any generic MIDI controller (controllers/surface), such as the JL Cooper FaderMaster, Peavey PC-1600, and Kenton Control Freak. Generic controllers/surfaces typically have 8â€“16 strips of faders-knobs-buttons, are non-motorized, and can often be configured to transmit MIDI messages (continuous controllers, non-registered parameter numbers (NRPNs), SysEx, etc.).


=== Computer configurations ===
Starting with version 6, Sonar can take advantage of 64-bit internal processing, a 64-bit audio engine, and a 64-bit mixer on 64-bit versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7. Before introduction of Sonar X2 in October of 2012, the entry-level Essential versions of Sonar (Sonar Home Studio and Sonar Essential) were 32-bit only. With the release of Sonar X2, the full program family is native 64-bit.
