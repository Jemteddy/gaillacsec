The false girdled lizard (Hemicordylus capensis) is a lizard species endemic to the Cape Fold Belt of southern South Africa.


== Description ==
The maximum snout-to-vent length is about 76 mm. Like its sister species Hemicordylus nebulosus, it has gracile features, with a phenotype described as intermediate between typical Cordylus and the larger, more robust Pseudocordylus. They have long limbs, and long slender digits. Some populations are melanistic and sexually dichromatic.


== Habits ==
Their specialized adaptation to steep rock faces is believed to have favoured their agility and lightly armored anatomy. They give live birth to one to three young.
