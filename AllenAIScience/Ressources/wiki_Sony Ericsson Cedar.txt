The Sony Ericsson Cedar (j108i), also known as Sony Ericsson Cedar GreenHeart, is a mobile phone from SE's J series of phones produced by Sony Ericsson released in September 2010. It is no longer in production/sale from the producer. The phone is one of Sony Ericsson's environmentally friendly "Greenheart" range, featuring devices made of recycled materials, longer battery life and low-energy chargers, as well as minimal use of paper through reduced packaging and the replacement of the traditional printed user manual with one stored on the phone.
