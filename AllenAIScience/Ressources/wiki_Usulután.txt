Usulután is the 5th largest city in El Salvador, and capital of the Usulután Department in the south-east of El Salvador.
As of 2006, it is estimated to have population of 71,636 people. Usulután rests in a rich agricultural valley and has very high and humid temperatures most of the year as it is located close to the Pacific Ocean. The city was badly damaged by the Salvadorian earthquakes of February 2001, in addition to Hurricane Mitch in 1998.
The main Catholic Church of the town is located in a park area next to the Town Hall (Alcaldia) and next to the Cine Centenario (a cinema) which are roughly located at the center of the town. Recently, Usulután has modernized considerably, having more influence from brand names such as Pollo Campero (a chicken restaurant), Biggest (a hamburger place similar to America's Burger King), and more eateries that were not available there in the past.
