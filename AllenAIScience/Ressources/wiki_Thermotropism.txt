Thermotropism or Thermotropic Movement is the movement of a plant or part of a plant in response to a change in temperature. A common example is the curling of Rhododendron leaves in response to cold temperatures. Mimosa Pudica also show thermotropism by the collapsing of leaf petioles leading to the folding of leaflets, when temperature drops.
