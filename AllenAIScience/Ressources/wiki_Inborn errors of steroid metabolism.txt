An inborn error of steroid metabolism is an inborn error of metabolism due to defects in steroid metabolism.

A variety of conditions of abnormal steroidogenesis exist due to genetic mutations in the enzymes involved in the process, of which include:
18,20-Desmolase (P450scc) deficiency: blocks production of all steroid hormones from cholesterol
3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 deficiency: impairs progestogen and androgen metabolism; prevents the synthesis of estrogens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids; causes androgen deficiency in males and androgen excess in females
Combined 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency: impairs progestogen metabolism; prevents androgen, estrogen, and glucocorticoid synthesis; causes mineralocorticoid excess
Isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency: prevents androgen and estrogen synthesis
21-Hydroxylase deficiency: prevents glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis; causes androgen excess in females
11β-Hydroxylase type 1 deficiency: impairs glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid metabolism; causes glucocorticoid deficiency and mineralocorticoid excess as well as androgen excess in females
11β-Hydroxylase type 2 deficiency: impairs corticosteroid metabolism; results in excessive mineralocorticoid activity
18-Hydroxylase deficiency: impairs mineralocorticoid metabolism; results in mineralocorticoid deficiency
18-Hydroxylase overactivity: impairs mineralocorticoid metabolism; results in mineralocorticoid excess
17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency: impairs androgen and estrogen metabolism; results in androgen deficiency in males and androgen excess and estrogen deficiency in females
5α-Reductase type 2 deficiency: prevents the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone; causes androgen deficiency in males
Aromatase deficiency: prevents estrogen synthesis; causes androgen excess in females
Aromatase excess: causes excessive conversion of androgens to estrogens; results in estrogen excess in both sexes and androgen deficiency in males
In addition, several conditions of abnormal steroidogenesis due to genetic mutations in receptors, as opposed to enzymes, also exist, including:
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) insensitivity: prevents synthesis of sex steroids by the gonads in both sexes
Follicle-stimulating (FSH) hormone insensitivity: prevents synthesis of sex steroids by the gonads in females; merely causes problems with fertility in males
Luteinizing hormone (LH) insensitivity: prevents synthesis of sex steroids by the gonads in males; merely causes problems with fertility in females
Luteinizing hormone (LH) oversensitivity: causes androgen excess in males, resulting in precocious puberty; females are asymptomatic
No activating mutations of the GnRH receptor in humans have been described in the medical literature, and only one of the FSH receptor has been described, which presented as asymptomatic.
