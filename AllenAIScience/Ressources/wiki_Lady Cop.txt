== Fictional character biographyEdit ==


=== OriginEdit ===
Lady Cop is Liza Warner, a young woman who watches from beneath a bed as a murderer in cowboy boots decorated with the skull and crossbones, slaughters her two roommates, leaving the ace of spades behind as his calling card. Later a policewoman (circa 1975) praises her eidetic memory, calling her "natural police". Deciding that she will never be able to rest until she finds the murderer, Liza enrolls in the unnamed metropolitan city's police academy. At her academy graduation ceremony, Liza disarms a madman carrying a primed grenade.


=== Poisoned LoveEdit ===
In the book's main story Liza foils the attempted rape of an underaged girl, and then disables and arrests the two assailants after they attempt to sexually assault her. She later disarms a switchblade wielding madman and performs Cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a stabbing victim. Later she counsels a panicky young woman on the dangers of sexually transmitted disease, helps the girl to reconcile a relationship with her dock worker father, and finally fends off an attack by a chain wielding gang member who'd been stalking her all day and saves him from drowning. In the issue's final panel Liza wonders if she will ever find the mysterious "Killer in Boots".


=== All-New AtomEdit ===

Liza Warner returned to the DC Universe in the pages of All-New Atom #6 and #11, now having become Chief of Police for Ivy Town. She advises and assists the new Atom Ryan Choi.


== In other mediaEdit ==
Rutina Wesley portrayed Liza Warner in the fourth season of Arrow. She was said to be an original recruit for the Anti-Vigilante task force when Oliver Queen first began his crusade as The Hood. After he officially became Green Arrow and his team expanded to Laurel Lance/Black Canary, John Diggle, Felicity Smoak, and Thea Queen/Speedy, the task force was reassembled due to Star City falling on hard times and Captain Lance needed the extra support and many still believe that Team Arrow isn't the heroic force they've become. Due to these hard times brought on upon three terrorist attacks (Merlyn, Deathstroke, Ras al Ghul) and the impending new one from Damien Darhk, she and the rest of the task force describe their actions as desperation to fix the city and support their families. They go on drug raids that kill all the drug gang members they confront and they in turn sell the drugs themselves while whipping out street crime. It isn't until they kill two detectives during a raid that they get the attention of both Captain Lance and Team Arrow. After they set an unsuccessful trap, they are able to identify Liza Warner as the leader and she later comes up with a plan to use Captain Lance's knowing of her as a means to get him to unlock the drug disposal warehouse where they'll steal all the drugs and disappear from Star City and be set financially. Team Arrow shows up to stop them and Liza almost kills Green Arrow until Captain Lance is able to talk her down and remind her why she become a cop. She later surrenders and Lance takes her into custody with Green Arrow surviving. It is presumed that because of her action, Warner was fired from Star City Police Department and subsequently recruited by H.I.V.E. as a bounty hunter.
