Reflections is a remix album by German singer Sandra, released in 2006 and includes re-recorded versions of Sandra's hits from the 1980s.


== Background and recording ==
Virgin Records suggested that vocal recordings of Sandra's biggest hits be sent to different teams of producers/remixers so that they could produce entirely new music. Sandra hesitated at first because she had already put out a remix collection in 1999 and did not want to promote all of her former hits once again. She had already finished her eighth studio album and wished to move forward in a new musical direction. Nevertheless, Christian Geller, Schallbau, Felix J. Gauder, Matthias Menck, Ivo Moring and Mirko von Schlieffen delivered a successful result. In late 2006, Reflections was issued.
Sandra's 1987 dance hit "Everlasting Love" even got a new vocal and was redone as a powerful ballad and distributed to the radio stations as a promotional single. Although the album reached the Top 10 of many online stores worldwide, no commercial single was released and as far as publicity goes not much more was done to promote this album. However, the radio single "Around My Heart 2006" became a huge hit in Poland, where the record company decided to promote it on the radio stations.


== Special edition ==
In 2007, Virgin Music France decided to release a special version of Reflections, containing three new remixes made by French DJs. These three tracks are as follows: "In the Heat of the Night" (Future Vision Remix - Radio Edit), "Maria Magdalena" (Junior Caldera Remix - Radio Edit), and "In the Heat of the Night" (Superfunk Remix - radio Edit). "In the Heat of the Night 2007" was released online as a digital single containing four new versions of the song, whereas "(I'll Never Be) Maria Magdalena" was not.
