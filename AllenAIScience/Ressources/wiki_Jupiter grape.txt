The Jupiter grape is an interspecific seedless Muscat grape developed at the University of Arkansas in 1998. It is a cross of Arkansas 1258 x Arkansas 1762. The Muscat flavor comes from “Gold” (vitis vinifera); the seedlessness comes from “Reliance.” Contains V. labrusca and V. vinifera. This grape is patented by the University of Arkansas.
Jupiter has large, oval blue-purple berries on large clusters. Its skins are not too tough or too tart to impede its desirability as a table grape. It has mild but pleasant flavor and a pronounced flowery "Muscat-type" aromatic profile that carries through in wines made from it. It can be trained to an upright growth habit. The grape has moderate-to-strong resistance to fungal diseases, and can be grown successfully in climates as different as the South and the Pacific Northwest. The variety can attain 21 Brix in sugars and can reach a high yield of approximately 8-13 tons per acre, making it a potentially valuable cash crop.
Cliff Ambers’ chemistry for Jupiter, on Aug 9, 2010, in Western Virginia, was pH 3.45; TA 0.51%; and 19.4 Brix. Although Jupiter is primarily considered a table grape, these are good numbers for wine production, with an acid addition.
In 2012, in Aurora, Oregon, Jupiter achieved the following harvest parameters: 21.5 Brix, pH 3.56, TA 0.70%. Those are nearly ideal numbers for winemaking.
Stephen Bailey in New York (near Hudson River) suggests limiting Jupiter's yield to 20-25 lbs per vine, and notes that one advantage of Jupiter is that birds do not prefer it.
Many grapegrowers find it easy to grow Jupiter.
