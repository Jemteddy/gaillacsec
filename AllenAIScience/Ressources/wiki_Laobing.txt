Laobing (also: Luobing; Chinese: 烙餅; pinyin: làobǐng, lùobǐng) is a type of unleavened flatbread popular in parts of northern China, including Beijing. It is sometimes referred to as a Chinese pancake.
Laobing can be the size of a large pizza, about one centimeter thick, and is doughy and chewy in texture. The bing is made by pan frying a rolled and layered unleavened dough consisting of salt, flour, and water. Most laobing are plain, although some have scallions or brown sugar inside the pastry. Laobing is usually cut into slices and served as a staple food, or can be stir-fried with meat and vegetables to make chaobing (stir-fried Chinese pancakes). Laobing is becoming increasingly popular in other parts of the world, particularly Australasia, due to the increased immigration from China.
