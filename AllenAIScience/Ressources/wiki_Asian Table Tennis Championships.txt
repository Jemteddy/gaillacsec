The Asian Table Tennis Championships is a biennial table tennis tournament regarded as continental championships by International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). From 1952 to 1972, the tournament was organized by the Table Tennis Federation of Asia (TTFA). The Asian Table Tennis Union (ATTU) started its own Asian Championships due to split between national table tennis associations in Asia.
