The All-Ireland final was a unique occasion as it was the first ever championship meeting between Ballyhale Shamrocks and Castlegar. Ballyhale Shamrocks were hoping to win their second All-Ireland title while Gort were hoping to claim their first title.
Ballyhale Shamrocks were without the services of Liam Fennelly who sustained a leg injury playing for Kilkenny against Waterford. Castlegar held a half-time lead of 0-7 to 0-5. In the 41st minute the game was slipping away from Ballyhale when the selectors decided to risk Fennelly in spite of his injury. After setting up a goal for his brother Kevin he later engineered two frees to tie the match at 1-10 apiece. A third free, once again won by Fennelly, was sent wide.
The replay didn't take place for seven weeks and, once again, it was a close affair. The sides were level at 0-4 apiece after twenty minutes, before a goal from Ger Fennelly and a point from his brother Kevin put them ahead by 1-5 to 0-4 at the interval. The Gort challenege faltered in the second half and they only added two more points after the break.
Ballyhale Shamrocks victory secured their second All-Ireland title. They became the fifth club to win a second All-Ireland title.
