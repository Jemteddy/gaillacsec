"Eat the Music" is a song written and recorded by Kate Bush. Columbia Records published it as the lead release from Bush's album The Red Shoes in the U.S., while EMI chose "Rubberband Girl" everywhere else in the world. It was released in the Netherlands and a few other countries 7 or 8 months later, but never in the UK as an A-side, except for a small handful of extremely rare 7"s and promo CD singles, which remain in circulation despite being recalled by the label. As a result of its release history, Eat the Music is listed in some places as an Extended Play and in others as a single.
"Eat the Music" is about opening up in relationships to reveal who we really are inside. The single reached number ten in the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart.
Tricky included the song on his edition of the mix album series Back to Mine.
