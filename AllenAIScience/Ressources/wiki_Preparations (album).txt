Preparations is the fourth full-length album by Prefuse 73, released on October 23, 2007 on Warp Records (see 2007 in music). Unlike the 2006 EP Security Screenings, Preparations is considered the proper follow-up to 2005's collaboration-heavy Surrounded by Silence. In contrast to that album, Preparations features only one guest vocalist.
The album includes a 15-track bonus disc entitled Interregnums, which features "unheard explorations into orchestral soundtrack music", including compositions played by live musicians.
