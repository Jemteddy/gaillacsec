Quasisolid or semisolid is the physical term for something that lies along the boundary between a solid and a liquid. While similar to a solid in some respects, in that semisolids can support their own weight and hold their shapes, a quasisolid also shares some properties of liquids, such as conforming in shape to something applying pressure to it and the ability to flow under pressure. The words quasisolid, semisolid, and semiliquid all mean exactly the same thing.
Quasisolids and semisolids are also known as amorphous solids because at the microscopic scale they have a disordered structure unlike the more common crystalline solids.
