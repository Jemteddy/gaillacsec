London Buses route 30 is a Transport for London contracted bus route in London, England. Running between Hackney Wick and Marble Arch station, it is operated by Tower Transit.


== History ==

Route 30 commenced operation on 8 May 1911 between King's Cross and Fulham Cross. Some of this routing is still covered today by route 30, as well as by related routes 74 and 430.
During the war years the buses used on this route were the earlier batch of pre war AEC Regent III RTs and operated from Hackney Wick to Roehampton.
By 1987 the route had been amended to run from Hackney to Earl's Court, taking about 75 minutes to complete the journey, at a frequency of one bus every 14 minutes. Driver-only operation was introduced in January 1987 with double-deckers, and three months later the route was reported to be carrying around 20,000 passengers per day.
In June 2010, the route was revealed to be the sixth worst performing route in London. As a result of this, new bus priority measures were introduced on the route.
On 22 June 2013, route 30 was included in the sale of First London's Lea Interchange garage to Tower Transit.


=== Tender Results ===
Upon being re-tendered in 2010, the route was awarded to First London from 25 June 2011.


== Bomb incident ==

On 7 July 2005 at 09:47, a Stagecoach London Dennis Trident 2 double-decker bus, fleet number 17758, registration LX03 BUF, was involved in a terrorist attack perpetrated by Hasib Hussain, a bomb in whose rucksack exploded, killing 13 other passengers as well as himself. The explosion ripped the roof off the top deck of the bus and destroyed the back of the vehicle. The detonation took place close to the British Medical Association building in Tavistock Square. The bus was off line of route and on diversion due to earlier multiple attacks on the London Underground system. The bus was replaced by the first Alexander Dennis Enviro400 produced, named Spirit of London to symbolise the courage of Londoners.
