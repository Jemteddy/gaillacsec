The Lemon Bud Moth (Prays parilis) is a moth of the Yponomeutidae family. It is found in Australia (New South Wales and Queensland), New Zealand and the Cook Islands.
The larvae feed on the flowers of lemon trees and can cause fruit to become misshapen and deformed. The larvae are yellowish to reddish-brown in colour and grow up to 10 mm in length. They are most commonly found within the buds of unopened lemon flowers. Affected flowers can often be identified by the small exit hole left by larvae.
