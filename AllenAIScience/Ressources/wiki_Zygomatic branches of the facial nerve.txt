The zygomatic branches of the facial nerve (malar branches) run across the zygomatic bone to the lateral angle of the orbit, where they supply the Orbicularis oculi, and join with filaments from the lacrimal nerve and the zygomaticofacial branch of the maxillary nerve.


== Clinical relevance ==
To test the zygomatic branches of the facial nerve, a patient is asked to close their eyes tightly.
