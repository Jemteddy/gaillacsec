20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is a 1997 television movie produced by Hallmark Entertainment, based on the novel of the same name by Jules Verne and starring Ben Cross as Captain Nemo. It premiered on March 23, 1997. It is most notable for replacing the character of Professor Aronnax's manservant, Conseil, with the Professor's daughter, Sophie, who disguises herself as a boy so that she may accompany her father aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln; she becomes the apex of a love triangle involving Captain Nemo and Ned the harpooner.
