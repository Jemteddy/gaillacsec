Blinking Lights and Other Revelations is the sixth studio album by American band Eels. It was recorded over the space of 1998 to 2004 and released on April 26, 2005 through record label Vagrant, his first album on a new label following Eels' departure from DreamWorks Records.
A double album, Blinking Lights has been seen as one of frontman E's most personal records, and was met with some of the strongest critical reviews of his career. The album features guest appearances by Tom Waits, Peter Buck and John Sebastian.


== Background ==

Eels frontman E described Blinking Lights on the official website as being about "God and all the questions related to the subject of God. It's also about hanging on to my remaining shreds of sanity and the blue sky that comes the day after a terrible storm, and it's a love letter to life itself, in all its beautiful, horrible glory."
The sleeve and liner notes are composed of typewritten lyrics and family photos.


== Release ==
The album was released through Vagrant Records on April 26, 2005, following the dissolution of Eels' contract with DreamWorks Records and the label's eventual take-over by Universal Music Group.
On October 21, 2008, the band announced that 2,500 autographed copies of the album would be published on vinyl. The songs were split across three records, with a fourth record serving as the bonus album Manchester 2005. The band made four of those tracks available as a free download for a week within announcing the album.


== Critical reception ==
Blinking Lights and Other Revelations was met with critical acclaim.
PopMatters wrote, "E is one of the best songwriters America has to offer, and he has made as personal, poignant and ultimately redeeming an album that you are ever going to hear." Entertainment Weekly wrote, "Everett finally delivers the absolute stone masterpiece fans have always known lurked inside his dour heart." Under the Radar called it "some of the best-written songs of this new century".
