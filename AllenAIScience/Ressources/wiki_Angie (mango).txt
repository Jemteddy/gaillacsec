The 'Angie' mango is a named mango cultivar that originated in south Florida.


== History ==
'Angie' was selected due to its relatively small growth habit, rich and complex flavor, and good disease resistance. It was named after Angie Whitman, wife of Bill Whitman and a trustee of the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden. 'Angie' was included as a Curator's Choice mango for the Fairchild Garden's 2010 mango festival. It was among several mangoes recommended by Fairchild's Curator of Tropical Fruit, Dr. Richard Campbell, for home growers.


== Description ==
'Angie' fruit is yellow to orange in color at maturity, and average about 400 grams in weight. The flavor is rich and sweet.
The trees are considered semi-dwarf and easy to manage through pruning.
