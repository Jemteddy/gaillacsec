Carriage driver redirects here.

Carriage driving is a form of competitive horse driving in harness in which larger two or four wheeled carriages (often restored antiques) are pulled by a single horse, a pair, tandem or a four-in-hand team.
Pleasure competitions also have classes which are judged on the turnout, neatness or suitability of the horse(s) and carriage.
