Solar power in Oklahoma on rooftops can provide 25% of all electricity used in Oklahoma.
Net metering is available to all consumers generating up to 100 kW, in one of the worst policies in the country, as excess generation could be lost monthly, giving the state an F. The primary reason to use net metering is to roll over summer generation to winter usage, which requires continuous roll over of excess generation. Net metering during the month does, however, allow generation during the day when all the lights are off and everyone is away to be used at night, after the sun has gone down. Since meters are read once a month, daily net metering is not reported. As more renewable energy is used, utilities have needed to become accustomed to incorporating local distributed generation.
In 2010, the American Solar Challenge ran from Oklahoma to Illinois, a solar car race.
