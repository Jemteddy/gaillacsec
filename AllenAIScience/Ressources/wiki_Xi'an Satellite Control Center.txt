The Xi'an Satellite Monitor and Control Center (XSCC), also known as Base 26, is the primary satellite control facility of the People's Republic of China. The facility was established in Weinan as the "Satellite Survey Department" in 1967, and relocated to Xi'an in 1987. Today, the XSCC comprises a mission control station in Xi'an and a set of tracking arrays located outside the city on a mountain plateau. The tracking station is equipped with antenna farms, masts, and communications dishes, while the mission control station is equipped with television screens, consoles, plotters, and high-speed computers that allow technicians to trace the orbital paths of all Chinese satellites in orbit.
