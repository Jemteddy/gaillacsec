In enzymology, a NAD+-diphthamide ADP-ribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.36) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
NAD+ + peptide diphthamide  nicotinamide + peptide N-(ADP-D-ribosyl)diphthamide
Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are NAD+ and peptide diphthamide, whereas its two products are nicotinamide and peptide N-(ADP-D-ribosyl)diphthamide.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, to be specific, the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NAD+:peptide-diphthamide N-(ADP-D-ribosyl)transferase. Other names in common use include ADP-ribosyltransferase, mono(ADPribosyl)transferase, and NAD-diphthamide ADP-ribosyltransferase.
