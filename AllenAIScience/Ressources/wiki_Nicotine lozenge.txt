A nicotine lozenge is a tablet (usually flavored) that contains a dose of nicotine which dissolves slowly in the mouth to release the nicotine. The nicotine is absorbed through the lining of the mouth and enters the blood vessels. It is used as an aid in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), a process for smoking cessation. People using the lozenge should not smoke because of the increased risk of nicotine poisoning. The effects of the lozenge may be diminished from drinking anything fifteen minutes prior to taking the lozenge.
