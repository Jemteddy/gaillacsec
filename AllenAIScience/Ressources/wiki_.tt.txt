.tt is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet for the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.
The Trinidad and Tobago Network Information Centre (TTNIC) allows registrations under tt for second-level domains, and for third-level domains under the following domains: co.tt, com.tt, org.tt, net.tt, biz.tt, info.tt, pro.tt, int.tt, coop.tt, jobs.tt, mobi.tt, travel.tt, museum.tt, aero.tt, cat.tt, tel.tt and name.tt. Registration under the above domains is unrestricted and the registry does not require applicants to have a physical presence in Trinidad and Tobago. However, registrants with a foreign address are charged double.
In addition, there is mil.tt, restricted to entities in the Military of Trinidad and Tobago, edu.tt is a registry for educational institutions in Trinidad and Tobago, and gov.tt reserved for agencies of the government.
Domain hacks using .tt include mi.tt, a URL shortener used for the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign of Mitt Romney.
