The 'Laxton's Superb' is an apple cultivar that was developed in England in 1897. It is a cross breed between 'Wyken Pippin' and 'Cox's Orange Pippin'. It is a British apple with a green color and a dull red flush. It is a firm-textured dessert apple. The fruit is well known for its sweet and aromatic taste which is likened to the parent species it is derived from, the 'Cox's Orange Pippin'.


== History ==

'Laxton's Superb' was first bred in 1897 by Laxton Brothers and introduced in 1922 having received an Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society in 1921. Laxton Brothers were a famous Victorian era company of plant breeders from Bedford in England. Laxton Brothers were also well known for breeding numerous fruit varieties (apples and strawberries in particular). Thomas Laxton's company continued to trade after his death in 1893 as "Laxton Brothers" as the company was taken over by his sons and grandsons, until it ceased trading in 1957 when it was taken over by Bunyard Nurseries. Bunyard eventually shut down the company and the orchards were built upon. However, the Laxton variety of apple still lives on as the town of Bedford have planted an orchard of the Laxton apple trees. Winston Churchill was also believed to have ordered fruit trees and plants for his Chartwell estate in Westerham, Kent. There are also surviving Laxton apple trees at Bank Hall in Bretherton, Lancashire.

The Laxton Superb is self-fertile, but cross pollination will maximise the yield. The Laxton Superb generally flowers from April to May annually. The tree will usually provide a heavy crop which is best to be harvested in October.
