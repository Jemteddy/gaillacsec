Lymphatic disease is a class of disorders which directly affect the components of the lymphatic system.
Examples include Castleman's disease and lymphedema.
Diseases and disorder Hodgkin's Disease/Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is a type of cancer of the lymphatic system. It can start almost any where in the body. It's believed to be caused by HIV, Epstein-Barr Syndrome, age and family history. Symptoms include weight loss, fever, swollen lymph nodes, night sweats, itchy skin, fatigue, chest pain, coughing and/or trouble swallowing.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Lymphoma is a usually malignant cancer. It's caused by the body producing too many abnormal white blood cells. It is not the same as Hodgkin's Disease. Symptoms usually include painless, enlarged lymph node or nodes in the neck, weakness, fever, weight loss, and anemia.
Lymphadenitis is an infection of the lymph nodes usually caused by a virus, bacteria or fungi. Symptoms include redness and/or swelling around the lymph node.
Lymphangitis
Lymphangitis is an inflammation of the lymph vessels. Symptoms usually include swelling, redness, warmth, pain and/or red streaking around the affected area.
Lymphedema
Lymphedema is the chronic pooling of lymph fluid in the tissue. It usually starts in the feet or lower legs. It's also a side-effect of some surgical procedures.
Lymphocytosis
Lymphocytosis is a high lymphocyte count. It can be caused by an infection, blood cancer, lymphoma, or autoimmune disorders that are accompanied by chronic swelling.
