A copiotroph is an organism that tends to be found in environments which are rich in nutrients, particularly carbon, and are the opposite to oligotrophs, which survive in much lower carbon concentrations.
Copiotrophic organisms tend to grow in high organic substrate conditions, for example, sewage lagoons. They grow in organic substrate conditions up to 100x higher than oligotrophs.
