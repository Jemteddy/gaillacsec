Album – Generic Flipper is the debut album by the San Francisco band Flipper. In November 2007, Blender magazine ranked it #86 on their list of the 100 greatest "indie rock" albums of all time. It is also referred to as Album, Album: Generic, Generic Flipper, and just Generic. Generic Flipper was issued on CD for the first time by American Recordings (formerly Def American) in 1992 and later deleted. In 2008, the rights reverted to Flipper, and the album was reissued December 9, 2008 by Water Records. Former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, who joined Flipper in 2006, contributed liner notes to the new reissue. Kurt Cobain listed it in his top 50 albums of all time.
