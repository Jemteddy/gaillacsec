== CareerEdit ==
Evans joined Manchester City at the age of six. After several seasons in Manchester City's academy, Evans first came to prominence with several appearances on the bench for City during the 2012–13 season, although he was ultimately not given a debut for the senior team. In the following season, Evans began playing for the Elite Development Squad before being loaned to Crewe Alexandra at the end of October. Within a week he was given his first senior cap, being named in the starting line-up for Crewe's home league game against Bradford City, against whom he played a full 90 minutes. Evans' first goal for Crewe Alexandra came on 23 November against local rivals Port Vale.
On 30 January 2015, he joined Scunthorpe United on loan until the end of the season. Evans made 16 appearances during his loan spell, scoring once. On 22 September 2015, Evans made his First Team debut for Manchester City when he came on as a substitute during a 4-1 win against Sunderland in the League Cup. In doing so, he became the second Manchester City player to represent the club at all levels from under-8s right through to the senior team, after Chris Chantler.
On 20 October 2015, Evans joined Football League One club Walsall on a one-month loan deal. He made his Walsall debut on the same day against Barnsley and scored the opening goal in a 0–2 away win.
