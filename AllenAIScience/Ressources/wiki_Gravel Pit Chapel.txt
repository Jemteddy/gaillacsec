The Gravel Pit Chapel was established in 1715–6 in Hackney, then just outside London, for a Nonconformist congregation, which by the early 19th century began to identify itself as Unitarian. In 1809 the congregation moved to the New Gravel Pit Chapel nearby, while its old premises were taken over by Congregationalists. The New Gravel Pit Chapel was closed and demolished in 1969.


== History ==
The Gravel Pit Chapel was established in 1715–6 in Hackney, then a village north-east of London, for a congregation seceding from that of John Barker, after the death of Matthew Henry. It took its name from the gravel pit near the bowling green in Mare Street.
In 1809 the congregation moved to new premises in Paradise Place in 1809, and began to identify itself as Unitarian. The original building, from then on known as the "Old Gravel Pit Chapel" was taken over by Congregationalists. The New Gravel Pit Chapel was rebuilt in a Gothic style in 1857, and remained in use until its closure and demolition in 1969, although between 1940 and 1953 services were held in the church hall due to bomb damage. The former Old Gravel Pit Chapel still exists; in 2004 it was in use as a shoe factory. It was later described as being at the west end of Retreat Place, a row of almshouses.
