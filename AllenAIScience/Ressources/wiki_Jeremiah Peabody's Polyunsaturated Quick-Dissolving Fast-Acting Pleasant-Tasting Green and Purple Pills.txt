"Jeremiah Peabody's Polyunsaturated Quick-Dissolving Fast-Acting Pleasant-Tasting Green and Purple Pills" is a novelty song written and performed by Ray Stevens. It was released as a single in 1961 and became Stevens' first Hot 100 single, peaking at #35 in September. Its lyrics tell of a fictional "wonder drug" that, when taken in a daily dose, can cure a myriad of ailments.
The song is also notable for having the second-longest title (104 characters) of any single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the longest being the Stars on 45 debut single. The song seems to be referenced by the rap group D12 in the song Purple Pills and by Kritikal in "Green and Purple".
