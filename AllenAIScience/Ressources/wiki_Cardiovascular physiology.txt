Cardiovascular physiology is the study of the circulatory system, specifically addressing the physiology of the heart ("cardio") and blood vessels ("vascular").
These subjects are sometimes addressed separately, under the names cardiac physiology and circulatory physiology.
Although the different aspects of cardiovascular physiology are closely interrelated, the subject is still usually divided into several subtopics.


== HeartEdit ==

Cardiac output (= heart rate * stroke volume. Can also be calculated with Fick principle.)
Stroke volume (= end-diastolic volume - end-systolic volume)
Ejection fraction (= stroke volume / end-diastolic volume)
((Cardiac Output)) is mathematically ` to ((Systole))

Inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic states

Cardiac input (= heart rate * suction volume Can be calculated by inverting terms in Fick principle)
Suction volume (= end-systolic volume + end-diastolic volume)
Injection fraction (=suction volume / end-systolic volume)
Cardiac input is mathematically ` to (Diastole))

=== HemodynamicsEdit ===
Under most circumstances, the body attempts to maintain a steady mean arterial pressure.
When there is a major and immediate decrease (such as that due to hemorrhage or standing up), the body can increase the following:
Heart
Total peripheral resistance (primarily due to vasoconstriction of arteries)
Inotropic state
In turn, this can have a significant impact upon several other variables:
Stroke volume
Cardiac output
Pressure
Pulse pressure (systolic pressure - diastolic pressure)
Mean arterial pressure (usually approximated with diastolic pressure + 1/3 pulse pressure)
Central venous pressure
