A glucan molecule is a polysaccharide of D-glucose monomers, linked by glycosidic bonds.
Many beta-glucans are medically important. They represent a drug target for antifungal medications of the echinocandin class.


== TypesEdit ==
The following are glucans: (The α- and β- and numbers clarify the type of O-glycosidic bond.)


=== AlphaEdit ===

dextran, α-1,6-glucan with α-1,3-branches
glycogen, α-1,4- and α-1,6-glucan
pullulan, α-1,4- and α-1,6-glucan
starch, α-1,4- and α-1,6-glucan


=== BetaEdit ===

cellulose, β-1,4-glucan
chrysolaminarin, β-1,3-glucan
curdlan, β-1,3-glucan
laminarin, β-1,3- and β-1,6-glucan
lentinan, a strictly purified β-1,6:β-1,3-glucan from Lentinus edodes
lichenin, β-1,3- and β-1,4-glucan
pleuran, β-1,3- and β-1,6-glucan isolated from Pleurotus ostreatus
zymosan, β-1,3-glucan


== PropertiesEdit ==
Properties of Glucans include resistance to oral acids/enzyme and water insolubility.Glucans extracted from grains tend to be both soluble and insoluble.
