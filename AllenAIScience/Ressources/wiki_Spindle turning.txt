Spindle turning, or turning between centers, is a woodturning method referring to a piece of wood on a wood lathe that is being turned on its center axis.


== MethodEdit ==
For spindle turning, the wood is held on the lathe either by both ends (between the headstock and tailstock) or by one end only.
Wood is generally removed by running a turning tool down the slope of the wood from a larger diameter in the wood to a smaller diameter.


== ExamplesEdit ==
Spindle turning is the method used for items such as chair and table legs, lamps, cues, bats, candlesticks etc. i.e. long and thin objects.
