USS Eel (SS-354), would have been a Balao-class submarine, the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the eels, an order of voracious, snakelike fishes, having a smooth, slimy skin and no pelvic fins.
Eel‍ '​s construction was canceled on 23 October 1944.
The name USS Eel was used for a fictional U.S. Navy submarine in Edward L. Beach's 1955 novel Run Silent, Run Deep.
