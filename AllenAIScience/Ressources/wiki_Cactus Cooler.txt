Cactus Cooler, distinguished by its orange, yellow, and green label, is an orange-pineapple soft drink sold in the United States, mainly in the Southern California area and surrounding Southwestern United States. It is part of the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, and was previously distributed under the Canada Dry brand name. Cactus Cooler was inspired by the 1960s cartoon show The Flintstones in which a fictional Cactus Cooler was the favorite drink of character Fred Flintstone.
