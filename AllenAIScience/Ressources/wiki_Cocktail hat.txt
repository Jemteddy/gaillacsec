A cocktail hat is a small, extravagant hat for a woman. It is usually a component of evening wear and is intended as an alternative to a large-brimmed hat. These hats are often decorated with beads, jewels or feathers, as well as a veil. They are closely related to fascinators, which are extravagant hairpieces worn on the side of the head.
