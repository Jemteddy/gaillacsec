The hun is a Korean ocarina-like flute made of baked clay or other ceramics. It has a globular shape, with a blowing hole on top and several finger holes. It is used primarily in court music ensembles, although in the late 20th century some contemporary Korean composers began to use it in their compositions and film scores.
In Japan, the equivalent instrument is called tsuchibue (lit. "clay flute").
In China, the equivalent instrument is called Xun.
