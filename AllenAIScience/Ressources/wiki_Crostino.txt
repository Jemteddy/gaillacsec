Crostini (meaning "little crusts" in Italian; singular crostino) are an Italian appetizer consisting of small slices of grilled or toasted bread and toppings. The toppings may include a variety of different cheeses, meats, and vegetables, or may be presented more simply with a brush of olive oil and herbs or a sauce.
Along with bruschetta, crostini are thought to originate in medieval times when it was typical for Italian peasants to eat their meals on slices of bread instead of using ceramics.
