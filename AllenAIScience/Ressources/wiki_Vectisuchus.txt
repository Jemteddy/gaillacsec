Vectisuchus is a genus of goniopholidid mesoeucrocodylian, known from the Early Cretaceous-age Wealden Group of the Isle of Wight, England. It was a small, piscivorous crocodylomorph with a narrow, elongate snout, and relatively long forearms. The type specimen, SMNS 50984, was found in 1977. When discovered, it was complete and right-side-up, but the posterior portion was lost during excavation. Vectisuchus was described in 1980. The type species is V. leptognathus.
