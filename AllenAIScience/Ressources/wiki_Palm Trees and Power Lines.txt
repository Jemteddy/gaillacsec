Palm Trees and Power Lines is Sugarcult's fourth studio album. It was released on April 13, 2004. The album is named after the scenery in California where the band members live, as the skyline is littered with palm trees and power lines. On the album cover, a few pieces of Californian scenery can be seen in the background, such as a liquor store, which Tim Pagnotta visits in the documentary Back to the Disaster. The album contains the MTV hits "Memory" and "She's the Blade".

== Reception ==
Palm Trees and Power Lines received mixed to favorable reviews from critics. Johnny Loftus of Allmusic gives a favorable review, concluding that "Sugarcult are thankfully more concerned with pleasing the crowd than making a statement." Punktastic characterizes the album as "one hell of a grower," a record "that shows maturity without ever coming across as trite or predictable." The review goes on to call the album "a fine record which, while not as anthemic and instant as its predecessor, is destined to be a sure-fire summer hit."
