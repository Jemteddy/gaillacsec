Gradient analysis or ordination is an empirical analytical method used in plant community ecology to relate the abundances of various species in a plant community to various environmental gradients by ordination or by weighted averaging. These gradients are usually variables that are important in plant species distributions, and include temperature, water availability, light, and soil nutrients, or their closely correlated surrogates.
