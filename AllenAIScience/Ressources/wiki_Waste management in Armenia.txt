Armenia is underdeveloped in its waste management and recycling activities. According to Waste Atlas Armenia produces 368,618 tonnes of MSW per year or 119.8 kg/cap/year.


== Landfills ==
60 landfills exist in Armenia. No waste sorting, recycling, nor reuse takes place at any of them. Instead, garbage is dumped into a working area and then flattened using a bulldozer to create a layer of garbage 300 centimeters thick.


=== Nubarashen ===
The Nubarashen landfill (40°6′24.19″N 44°32′49.26″E) is Armenia's largest waste disposal site and is located near Yerevan. It receives almost all of the solid waste produced in the city of Yerevan and its suburbs, which is about 340 tons per day, or 102,000 tons per year. The site has accumulated over 7.5 million tons of domestic waste over 50 years.
