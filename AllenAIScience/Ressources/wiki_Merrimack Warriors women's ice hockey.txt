The Merrimack Warriors women's ice hockey team is a future National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I women's college ice hockey program that will represent Merrimack College. The Warriors will become a member of Hockey East, in which the men's program already competes in. They will play at the 3,000-seat J. Thom Lawler Arena in North Andover, Massachusetts, which underwent a major renovation in 2010.


== History ==
The women's ice hockey program will begin play in the 2013-14 academic year. The team will initially play a club schedule before transitioning to the NCAA by 2016-17 and joining the Hockey East. The college announced plans to add women's ice hockey, swimming, and water polo as part of its six-sport expansion plans following a settlement with U.S. Department of Education related to a Title IX gender-discrimination complaint.
