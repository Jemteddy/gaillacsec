== Production outputEdit ==


== Fiat in EuropeEdit ==

Fiat's main market is Europe, mainly focused in Italy. Historically successful in citycars and supermini sector, currently Fiat has a range of models focused on those two segments (in 2011, those accounted for the 84% of its sales). Fiat does not currently offer any large family car, nor an executive car.
Fiat's share of the European market shrank from 9.4 per cent in 2000 to 5.8 per cent in the summer of 2004. At this point Sergio Marchionne was appointed as Fiat Chief Executive. By March 2009 their market share had expanded back to 9.1%.
Fiat's built their five-story Lingotto plant in 1915 through 1918, at the time it was Europe's largest car manufacturing plant. Later the Mirafiori plant was built, also in Turin. To prepare for production of the all new Fiat 128, Fiat opened their Rivalta plant in October 1968. Until the 128 could enter production, the plant was used to build sports versions of the 850 and 124 as well as parts for the Fiat Dino.
Fiat current range of passenger car engines comprises eleven units, eight petrols and three diesels. Current range of models is the following:
City car: Fiat 500, Fiat Panda
Supermini: Fiat Punto
Compact car: Fiat Bravo, Fiat Linea
Mini MPV: Fiat 500L
Large MPV: Fiat Freemont (rebadged Dodge Journey)
Mini SUV: Fiat Sedici (developed with Suzuki with its twin Suzuki SX4)
Future models announced by Fiat include the 500X in 2014 to replace the Sedici.
Fiat sales of 2011 were up to 676.704 (minus 17.3% vs. previous year):
Light commercial vehicles are sold in Europe under the brand Fiat Professional.


== Fiat in South AmericaEdit ==

Fiat has invested for a longtime in South America, mainly in Brazil (where has been the market leader for many years) and in Argentina.
The Brazilian range is similar to European one, with the addition of a special family which derives from a common platform (called "Project 178"): Fiat Palio, Fiat Palio Weekend, Fiat Palio Adventure, Fiat Siena, Fiat Grand Siena.
Recently a brand new model developed in Brazil has been launched: the Fiat Uno.
Other European models are currently imported to Brazil: Fiat 500, Fiat Freemont. Some others are still in production: Fiat Punto, Fiat Idea, Fiat Bravo and Fiat Linea.
Fiat sells in Brazil under the Fiat brand, European Fiat Professional light commercial vehicles as:
Fiat Strada (developed in Brazil, has the same platform of Fiat Palio and Fiat Siena;
previous versions of European Fiat Doblò, Fiat Doblò Cargo, Fiat Fiorino (called here Fiat Fiorino Furgao), and Fiat Ducato;
the old European Fiat Uno Van called here Fiat Uno Furgao.


== Fiat in the United StatesEdit ==

Fiat has a long history in United States. In 1908, the Fiat Automobile Co. was established in the country and a plant in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., began producing Fiats a year later. These luxury cars were produced long before Chrysler Corp. started in 1925. Fiat was sometimes used as a jocular acronym for 'Fix it again Tony', referring to poor owner maintenance forgetting to re-torque the cylinder head every 20,000 miles and rust, due to poor cleaning of the undercarriage due to salt used in North America on icy roads some Fiat owners in cold climates of the United States encountered in the 1970s and 1980s. Partly as a result, Fiat sales in the US fell from a high of 100,511 cars in 1975 to 14,113 in 1982. In 1983, Fiat left the United States car market with a reputation for poor quality cars only in North America. In Russia, Asia, Europe and South America, Fiat continued to be a leader in technology and design and to this day many Fiats still are on the road today with over 1 million kilometers.  However, Fiat has made significant improvements since then.
In January 2009, the Fiat Group acquired a 20% stake in US automaker Chrysler LLC. The deal saw the return of the Fiat brand to North America after a 25-year absence. The first Fiat-branded model to appear in the US was the popular Fiat 500 city car. The Fiat 500 model is built at Chrysler's assembly plant in Toluca, Mexico, which currently makes also the Dodge Journey and Fiat Freemont crossovers.


== Fiat in AsiaEdit ==
Fiat's presence in Chinese market is limited compared to its European, Japanese, Korean and American rivals. At the beginning of 2012, Fiat was only importing Fiat Bravo and Fiat 500 model. However, in 2012 Fiat and GAC opened a Joint Venture plant to produce the first Fiat vehicle specifically developed for Chinese market ever: the Fiat Viaggio, a compact car derived by another model of Fiat SpA group, the Dodge Dart (in turn derived by another Fiat Group car, the Alfa Romeo Giulietta).
Fiat currently offers to Japanese consumers the 500 in both coupe and convertible bodystyles, and the Panda. Both vehicles are in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations affording the Japanese public to purchase a non-Japanese vehicle without having to pay an annual tax for driving a car that exceeds the regulations.
Fiat is also present in Indian market since 1948. Current presence is in Joint Venture with Tata Motors, although current car sales (Fiat is currently offering the Fiat Punto and Fiat Linea) are niche market and limited (approx. 20k units in 2011).

== MarketingEdit ==


=== LogoEdit ===

The FIAT initials was first used in the distinctive logo form 1901. In 1968 the "rhomboid" logo (as it was known internally) was introduced which featured the FIAT initials spelled out on four interconnected rhombuses. The rhomboid was slowly phased in during the early 1970s, although the older "laurel wreath" style FIAT badge was used to denote sporting models such as the 124 Spider, 127 Sport, X1/9 and the tuned Abarth models. A new corporate nose based on the rhomboid logo was first introduced in 1983 on the Uno, which consisted of five chrome bars inclined at an angle of 18 degrees to mirror the rhomboid, which usually appeared in reduced size at the corner of the grille.
In 1999 the wreath style logo was re-introduced to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the company.


=== Motor Village and Flagship storesEdit ===
Fiat launched its Motor Village flagship stores concept in 2006 with its Mirafiori Motor Village in Turin, followed by London's Flagship store in Wigmore Street opening in 2008 and Paris opening in 2010 on the Champs-Élysées.


=== BSM-Fiat dealEdit ===
In 2009, BSM (the British School of Motoring) ended a 16-year relationship with Vauxhall Motors and signed a deal with Fiat UK to swap its learner vehicle from the Vauxhall Corsa to the new Fiat 500. Fiat UK will supply 14,000 cars to BSM over four years in a marketing deal.
