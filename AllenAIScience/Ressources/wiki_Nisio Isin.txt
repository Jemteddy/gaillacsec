Nisio Isin (西尾 維新, Nishio Ishin, born 1981), frequently written as NisiOisiN to emphasize that his pen name is a palindrome, is a Japanese novelist and manga writer.
He attended and left Ritsumeikan University without graduating. In 2002, he debuted with the novel The Beheading Cycle (クビキリサイクル, Kubikiri Saikuru), which earned him the 23rd Mephisto Prize at twenty years of age. He currently works with Kodansha on Faust, a literary magazine containing the works of other young authors who similarly take influence from light novels and otaku culture, and Pandora, the Kodansha Box magazine. He was also publishing a twelve volume series over twelve months for the Kodansha Box line; Ryusui Seiryoin was matching this output, and the Kodansha Box website stated that this is the first time in the world two authors have done twelve volume monthly novel series simultaneously from the same publisher. In February, 2008, his novel Death Note Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases, which is based on the Death Note manga, was released in English by Viz Media. Del Rey Manga has already released the first and second volume in his Zaregoto series.
His Bakemonogatari and Katanagatari novels have been adapted into anime. The sequel (Nisemonogatari) novel has also been adapted as an anime, as well as most of the "Monogatari Series" to date. Another of his works, Medaka Box, has been adapted into a two-season anime series.


== StyleEdit ==
Nisio's work is characterized by references to other novels, as well as parodies of famous manga series. Among these, Hellsing and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure references are particularly common. He is well regarded as an author who has blended the conventions of mystery novels and character-driven light novels.
As well as stepping on the conventions and stereotypes of anime and light novels, he is known for creating characters with unusual features, such as extremely strange names which are word play, such as Nanananami Nanami, Shikigishi Kishiki, Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade, Backyard Bottomslash, Quarter Queen, Sagano Usagi, Byōinzaka Kuroneko (which translates roughly as "Black Cat of Hospital Hill") and Shikizaki Kiki.
He said that he learned much from the novels of Kiyoshi Kasai (the author of Vampire Wars), Hiroshi Mori, Natsuhiko Kyogoku, Ryusui Seiryoin and Kouhei Kadono. He also said that the five writers were, metaphorically speaking, the God-like beings, who had shaped and molded his writing style.
