This is a list of aircraft produced or proposed by Geoffrey de Havilland or designed by the de Havilland Aircraft Company from its founding in 1920 until its purchase by (and integration into) the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1959.
The aircraft are ordered by de Havilland model number; The numbers started with de Havilland's entry into the Airco company. although Airco built the planes, their design was owned by de Havilland and when de Havilland started his own company, he continued the numbering. This went on even for later designs of de Havilland's aircraft company, even if they were designed by a factory team with little input from de Havilland himself. The DH.89, for example, was the de Havilland's 89th design.
The designs DH.121 and DH.125 which were under development when de Havilland merged into the Hawker Siddeley Group kept their numbering and were produced as the Hawker 121 Trident and the Hawker 125.
The list does not include aircraft designed by de Havilland Canada or de Havilland Australia, founded as de Havilland subsidiaries.
