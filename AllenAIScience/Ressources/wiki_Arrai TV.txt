Arrai TV (Arabic قناة الرأي) was an Arabic-language television station based in Syria. The channel was owned by Misha'an al-Juburi. It is used by overseas Libyans to defend the Gaddafi government and denounce the NATO-led government and to keep morale up of those which have fled Libya since the war. The channel aired a number of audio messages from Gaddafi and his aides when they fled Tripoli. On 15 October 2011, Arrai TV posted a message mourning the death of Khamis Gaddafi on 29 August. The channel closed on 4 December 2011.
