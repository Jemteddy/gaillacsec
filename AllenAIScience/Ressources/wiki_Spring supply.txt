A spring supply is a provision of piped mains water to a number of consumers direct from a natural spring. The usual system of gathering water in a reservoir, treating and piping it to consumers is therefore not necessary. Water rates are not usually payable. Residents have no sewage network and must use septic tanks, which often have sand or gravel filters.


== Countries ==
In the United Kingdom, approximately 1% of the population rely on water supplies from private sources such as springs.


== Examples ==
