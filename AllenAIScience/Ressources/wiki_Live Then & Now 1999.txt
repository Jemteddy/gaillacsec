The Live Then & Now 1999 was a concert tour by the British multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield.


== Background ==
Then & Now was Oldfield's second tour of the 1990s, and was Oldfield's last full tour to date. It promoted both the Guitars and Tubular Bells III albums. Oldfield finished the 20th century by performing a one off concert on New Year's Eve 1999 in Berlin (see Art in Heaven). The Art in Heaven concert was in promotion of the Millennium Bell album.
