Monura is an extinct order of wingless insects in the subclass Apterygota. They resembled their modern relatives, the bristletails, and had a single lengthy filament projecting from the end of the abdomen. They also had a pair of leg-like cerci and some non-ambulatory abdominal appendages. The largest specimens reached 30 millimetres (1.2 in) or more, not counting the length of the filament.
