Tricuspid valve stenosis is a valvular heart disease which results in the narrowing of the orifice of the tricuspid valve of the heart. It is a relatively rare condition that causes stenosis- increased resistance to blood flow through the valve.


== Causes ==
It is almost always caused by rheumatic fever and is generally accompanied by mitral stenosis.
Rare other causes include carcinoid syndrome, endocarditis, endomyocardial fibrosis, lupus erythematosus, right atrial myxoma and congenital tricuspid atresia.


== Diagnosis ==
A mid diastolic murmur can be heard during auscultation caused by the blood flow through the stenotic valve. It is best heard over the left sternal border with rumbling character and tricuspid opening snap with wide splitting S1. May increase in intensity with inspiration (Carvallo's sign). The diagnosis and the severity can be assessed by echocardiography.


== Treatment ==
Tricuspid valve stenosis itself usually doesn't require treatment. However, if there is damage to other valves in the heart as well, then surgical repair or replacement must be considered.
The treatment is usually by surgery (tricuspid valve replacement) or percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty. The resultant tricuspid regurgitation from percutaneous treatment is better tolerated than insufficiency occurring during mitral valvuloplasty
