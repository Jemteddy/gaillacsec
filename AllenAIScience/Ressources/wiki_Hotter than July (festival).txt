Hotter Than July! began in 1996 as collaboration between numerous LGBT organizations â€” including the Billionaire Boys Club, Men of Color Motivation Group, Karibu House and Ladies of a Current Affair. The celebration was founded on the seven principals of Kwanzaa. Until 2003, Detroit Black Pride Society co-founder, Johnny Jenkins, served as the event's primary organizer. The event is now produced by the Detroit Black Pride Society and KICK.
In 2013, candidates for Detroit's mayoral race - Krystal Crittendon, Mike Duggan, Fred Durhal, and Jean Vortkamp - attended a special Hotter Than July! community forum. Candidate Benny Napoleon did not attend the forum, but did attend the Palmer Park Festival.
