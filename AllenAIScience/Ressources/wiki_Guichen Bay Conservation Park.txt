Guichen Bay Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Limestone Coast of South Australia overlooking Guichen Bay about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) north of the town of Robe. While protected status was first conferred to the land in 1967, its current status as a conservation park under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 was proclaimed in 1972. The following statements sourced respectively from the conservation parkâ€™s management plan and the now-discontinued Register of the National Estate summarises its conservation significance:

The Park contains some of the Guichen Bay beach ridge plain; a classic example of Holocene beach ridge development of worldwide interest which records the naturalhistory of the Bay over the last 7000 years.

Because of its inaccessibility this Park is rarely visited by people. The fairly dense coastal heath provides a home for the secretive DASYORNIS BROADBENTI (rufous bristle bird), while along the seashore dotterels and oystercatchers are common.

The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area.
