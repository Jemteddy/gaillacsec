The innermost intercostal muscle is a layer of intercostal muscles deep to the plane that contains the intercostal nerves and intercostal vessels and the internal intercostal muscles. These are divided into:
transversus thoracis anteriorly
lateral muscle slips laterally (which cross a single intercostal space)
subcostalis posteriorly (which often cross more than one intercostal space)
