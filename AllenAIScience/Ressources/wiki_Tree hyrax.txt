The tree hyraxes or tree dassies are the three species in the genus Dendrohyrax. They are mammals in the family Procaviidae (the only living family within the order Hyracoidea). The three species are:
Southern tree hyrax (Dendrohyrax arboreus), found in East and Southern Africa
Eastern tree hyrax (Dendrohyrax validus), found in East Africa.
Western tree hyrax (Dendrohyrax dorsalis), found in West and Central Africa
The tree hyrax is a small nocturnal mammal that is distantly related to elephants and sea cows. They have 4-toed front feet and 3-toed back feet with rounded nails, and rubbery soles that help them climb.
Colouring: Dependent on geographical location, their soft dense coats can range from a pale gray to light or dark brown. The variation is consistent with evolutionary development to aid with camouflage, so that in wetter regions with more verdant and abundant vegetation they are darker, and in more arid areas their colouring is lighter.
Territorial call: The male has a distinctive territorial call that starts with a series of loud measured cracking sounds, sometimes compared to 'a huge gate with rusted hinges being forced open'. This is then followed by a series of 'unearthly screams', ending in a descending series of expiring shrieks. Females also call, but lack the air pouches and enlarged larynx of the male, producing only a feeble imitation. On average there are two peak calling periods per night. Times vary, but the first period is often 2 â€“3 hours after dark, and the second at some point after midnight.
