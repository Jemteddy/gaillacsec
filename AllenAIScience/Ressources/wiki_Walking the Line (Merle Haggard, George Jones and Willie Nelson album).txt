Walking the Line is an album by American country music artists Merle Haggard, George Jones, and Willie Nelson, released in 1987.


== Background ==
Much like the successful seventies album Wanted! The Outlaws, Walking the Line features duets and solo cuts taken from various albums and repackaged as a single album. Jones and Haggard had recorded a duet album, A Taste of Yesterday's Wine in 1982 (the title cut having been by Nelson) while Haggard and Nelson had collaborated on Pancho & Lefty the same year. It reached number 39 on the Billboard country albums chart. All three artists had been under contract to CBS Records in the early eighties. The album does not feature a song with all three singing.
