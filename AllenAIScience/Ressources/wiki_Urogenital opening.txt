The urogenital opening is where bodily waste and reproductive fluids are expelled to the environment outside of the body cavity. In some organisms, including birds and many fish, discharge from the urological, digestive, and reproductive systems empty into a common sac called the cloaca. In many organisms, these three systems are more separated. In the human female, separate orifices have evolved for all three, while in the male, a common "urogenital orifice" discharges both urinary and reproductive fluids from the urethra.
