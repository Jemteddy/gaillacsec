N,N-Dimethylethylamine (DMEA), sometimes referred to as dimethylethylamine, is an organic compound with formula C4H11N. It is an industrial chemical that is mainly used in foundries as a catalyst for sand core production. Dimethylethylamine is a malodorous, volatile liquid at room temperature that is excreted at greater concentrations with larger dietary intake of trimethylamine. It has recently been identified as an agonist of human trace amine-associated receptor 5.
