Faster Than the Speed of Night is the fifth studio album by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler. It was released first in Europe in April 1983 through Columbia Records. Tyler had changed musical direction from country music in 1980, and began working with Jim Steinman soon after, who produced the album and wrote its most successful single "Total Eclipse of the Heart".
It was certified Silver in the UK, Platinum in the United States, and Double Platinum in Canada.


== ContentEdit ==
The album consists of dramatically re-worked cover songs, including the Creedence Clearwater Revival hit "Have You Ever Seen the Rain?". "Goin' Through the Motions" is a Blue Öyster Cult cover from their 1977 album Spectres, and the original version of "Straight from the Heart" was the breakout Top 10 hit—from the Platinum Cuts Like A Knife album—by Canadian rock singer/songwriter Bryan Adams. It also included the song "Take Me Back" written by Billy Cross, a former Bob Dylan guitarist.
