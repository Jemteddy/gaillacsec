Oxford University Handball Club (OUHaC) was founded and registered as a club at the University of Oxford in 2001 and has since established itself as one of England's most successful clubs. It is a member of the England Handball Association since 2002 and the Association of British Universities Handball Clubs since 2011.


== Men's team ==
The men's team won the British Student Championship title in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2013 as well as the English National Title in 2006, being the first ever University Team in the history of English handball to win the National League Title. They have been too the first university team to compete in the EHF Challenge Cup (2006–07 and 2007–08). They have also won two mixed English Beach Handball tournaments.


== Women's team ==
The Women's team was created within the club in 2003. The team has always been suffering from lack of players, which led in season 2005-2006 to merge the Oxford and the Southampton teams. Women's team has been runner up in the English League in 2006 and in the University Championships that very same year.
