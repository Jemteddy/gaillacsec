Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request is the fourth album by American psychedelic rock band The Brian Jonestown Massacre, the second of three critically acclaimed albums released by the band in 1996. It was released on Tangible Records, distributed by Bomp! Records. The title is both a pun on and a tribute to the Rolling Stones' 1967 album, Their Satanic Majesties Request.


== Music and InfluencesEdit ==
In homage to and influenced by the Stones' somewhat controversial psychedelic album, Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request reveals vast experimentation with Indian drones, sitars, mellotrons, farfisas, didgeridoos, tablas, congas, and glockenspiels. Following in the footsteps of Keith Richards and Brian Jones, BJM capture and explore the psychedelic rock sound of the late 1960s. The opening track, All Around You (Intro), pays tribute to the showmanship of the Stones, calling one and all to the psychedelic trip that they are about to experience. Sensationally mellow and trippy, the track is also reminiscent of the famous Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band's eponymous opening number and also contains elements of Donovan's Atlantis.
The song "Donovan Said" is itself a tribute to Donovan's "The Fat Angel", mimicking the vocal patterns of the verse at about a 3/4's of the speed.
