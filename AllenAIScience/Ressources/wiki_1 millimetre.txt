Distances shorter than 1 mm
1.0 mm — 1/1000 of a metre
1.0 mm — 0.03937 inches or 5/127 (exactly)
1.0 mm — side of square of area 1 mm²
1.0 mm — diameter of a pinhead
1.5 mm — length of average flea
2.54 mm — distance between pins on old DIP (dual-inline-package) electronic components
5 mm — length of average red ant
5.56×45mm NATO — standard ammunition size
6 mm—approximate width of a pencil
7.62×51mm NATO — common military ammunition size
