A figure-eight loop (also figure-eight on a bight or Flemish loop or Flemish eight) is a type of knot created by a loop on the bight. It is used in climbing and caving where rope strains are light to moderate and for decorative purposes. The knot is commonly followed by tying a strangle knot (AKA Half a Double Fisherman's Knot) or an overhand knot around the standing end.
The double figure eight is used to put a loop in the end of a rope, or around an object. It is relatively easy to tie and is secure, but can become difficult to untie after heavy loading, and can jam badly in any rope type.


== Tying methodsEdit ==


=== TraditionalEdit ===

A figure-eight loop is created by doubling the rope into a bight, then tying the standard figure-eight knot.


=== Follow ThroughEdit ===
Alternatively, to tie the knot directly around an object, the follow through method must be used.
Tie a regular figure eight knot with a significant amount of extra tail.
Loop the tail around the object.
Thread the tail back through the figure eight to create a normal looking figure eight on a bight.
