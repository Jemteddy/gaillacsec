=== Keyword research ===
The objective of keyword research is to generate, with good precision and recall, large number of terms that are highly relevant yet non obvious to the given input keyword. Process of keyword research involves brainstorming and the use of keyword research tools. To achieve best SEO results, it is important to pick the most relevant keywords. It is good practice to pick keywords that have little competition and a high number of searches. Little competition makes it easier to achieve higher rank in search engines, and high numbers of searches guarantees that the keyword attracts web traffic. The downside of this practice is that usually keywords that have little competition get fewer§ searches, while those searched millions of times a month are difficult to rank for. There are three important concepts to consider when conducting a keyword research. Good keywords are related to the theme of the website. search engine algorithm has the right to ban or exclude from search results websites whose content is not relevant to the keyword. Good Keyword that are highly competitive are less likely to rank in the top. Keywords that have no monthly searches generate no traffic, and therefore are useless for SEO.

A very popular and highly competitive keyword on Google search engine is "making money". It has 2 890 000 000 search results, meaning that millions of websites are competing for that keyword. Keyword research starts with finding all possible word combinations that are relevant to the "making money" keyword. For example, a keyword "acquiring money" has significantly less search results, only 47 900 000, but it has the same meaning as "making money". Another way is to be more specific about a keyword by adding additional filters. Keyword "making money online from home in Canada" is less competitive on a global scale and therefore easier to rank for.
