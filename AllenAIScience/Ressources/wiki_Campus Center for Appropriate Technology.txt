The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) is a student-run sustainability organization located at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California. CCAT has partnered with Appropedia to bring over 30 years of student-based open-source appropriate technology solutions to the world.
The organization is housed in a 70-year-old house and contains scores of resource-saving devices such as solar roof panels, a gravity-based rainwater collection system to water the gardens, and an electrical generator which runs on biodiesel made from cooking oil from the school's cafeteria.
