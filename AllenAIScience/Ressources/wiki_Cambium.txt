A cambium (plural cambia or cambiums), in botany, is a tissue layer that provides undifferentiated cells for plant growth. It forms parallel rows of cells, which result in secondary tissues.
There are several distinct kinds of cambium found in plant stems and roots:
Cork cambium, a tissue found in many vascular plants as part of the periderm.
Unifacial cambium, which produces cells to the interior of its cylinder.
Vascular cambium, a lateral meristem in the vascular tissue of plants.
