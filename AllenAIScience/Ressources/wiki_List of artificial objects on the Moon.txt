List of artificial objects on the Moon is a partial listing of artificial materials on the Lunar surface. The table below does not separately list small items such as retroreflectors, Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Packages, or the commemorative and personal objects left there by Apollo astronauts, such as the golf balls from Alan Shepard's lunar driving practice during Apollo 14, flags, Alan Bean's silver astronaut pin, or the Fallen Astronaut statuette left by the crew of Apollo 15.
The remains of five S-IVB third stages of Saturn V rockets from the Apollo program are the heaviest single pieces sent to the Lunar surface. Humans have left over 187,400 kilograms (413,100 lb) of material on the Moon, and 380 kilograms (838 lb) of Moon rock was brought back to Earth by Apollo and Luna missions. The only artificial objects on the Moon that are still in use are the retroreflectors for the lunar laser ranging experiments left there by the Apollo 11, 14, and 15 astronauts and by the Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2 missions.
Objects at greater than 90 degrees east or west are on the far side of the Moon, including Ranger 4, Lunar Orbiter 1, Lunar Orbiter 2, and Lunar Orbiter 3.
