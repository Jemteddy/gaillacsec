In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, a polygon-circle graph, also called a spider graph, is a type of an intersection graph, where each vertex is represented as a polygon and each edge as an intersection of two polygons representing those vertices, enclosed by a bounding circle. All corners of all polygons lie on the bounding circle. They were first suggested by Michael Fellows in 1988.
A polygon-circle graph can be represented as an "alternating sequence". Such a sequence can be gained by cutting the bounding circle in an arbitrary point and listing the polygons, as we go along. Such sequence is unique.


== Recognition ==
M. Koebe announced a polynomial time recognition algorithm, but it was never published. The algorithm was first published by M. Pergel and J. Kratochvíl.
