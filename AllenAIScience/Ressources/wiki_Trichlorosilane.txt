Trichlorosilane is an inorganic compound with the formula HSiCl3. It is a colourless, volatile liquid. Purified trichlorosilane is the principal precursor to ultrapure silicon in the semiconductor industry. In water, it rapidly decomposes to produce a silicone polymer while giving off hydrochloric acid. Because of its reactivity and wide availability, it is frequently used in the synthesis of silicon-containing organic compounds.


== Production ==
Trichlorosilane is produced by treating powdered metallurgical grade silicon with blowing hydrogen chloride at 300 °C. Hydrogen is also produced, as described in the chemical equation:
Si + 3 HCl → HCl3Si + H2
Yields of 80-90% can be achieved. The major byproducts are silicon tetrachloride (chemical formula SiCl4), hexachlorodisilane (Si2Cl6), and dichlorosilane (H2SiCl2), from which trichlorosilane can be separated by distillation.

It is also produced from silicon tetrachloride:
Si + 3 SiCl4 + 2 H2 → 4 HSiCl3


== Applications ==
Trichlorosilane is the basic ingredient used in the production of purified polysilicons.

HSiCl3 → Si + HCl + Cl2

Via hydrosilylation, trichlorosilane is a precursor to other useful organosilicon compounds:
RCH=CH2 + HSiCl3 → RCH2CH2SiCl3
Some useful products of this or similar reactions include octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS), perfluoroctyltrichlorosilane (PFOTCS), and perfluordecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS). These reagents used in surface science and nanotechnology to form Self-assembled monolayers. Such layers containing fluorine decrease surface energy and reduce sticking. This effect is usually exploited as coating for MEMS and microfabricated stamps for a nanoimprint lithography (NIL) and an injection molding tools.
