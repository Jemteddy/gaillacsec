The Lothagam is a palaeontological formation located in Kenya. It dates to the Miocene-Pliocene period.
It is located near the southwestern shores of Lake Turkana, 55 kilometres from Kanapoi. It is located between Kerio and Lomunyenkuparet rivers on an uplifted fault block. 
Bryan Patterson from Harvard University was, in 1967, the first to carry out paleontological research in Lothagam.
