Tre recombinase is an experimental enzyme that in lab tests has successfully removed DNA inserted by HIV from infected cells. The enzyme was derived from Cre recombinase through selective mutation for the purposes of identifying HIV markers, which are not bounded by loxP sites and therefore disallow attempts at Cre-Lox recombination.
