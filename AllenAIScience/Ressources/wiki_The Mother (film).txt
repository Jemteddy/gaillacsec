The Mother is a 2003 British film directed by Roger Michell.


== Plot ==
May (played by Anne Reid) is an ordinary grandmother from Northern England. When her husband dies on a family visit to London, she recedes into the background of her busy, metropolitan children's lives. Trapped in an unfamiliar city, far from home, May fears that she has become another invisible old lady whose life is more or less over. She embarks on a sexual affair with Darren (Daniel Craig), a married handyman half her age who is renovating her son's house and is also her daughter's lover. As her sexual desire soon turns to emotional longing, May unwittingly embroils herself into a point-of-no-return situation with devastating results for all those surrounding her.
