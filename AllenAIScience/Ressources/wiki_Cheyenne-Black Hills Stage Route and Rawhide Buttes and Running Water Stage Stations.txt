The Rawhide Buttes Stage Station, the Running Water Stage Station and the Cheyenne-Black Hills Stage Route comprise a historic district that commemorates the stage coach route between Cheyenne, Wyoming and Deadwood, South Dakota. The route operated from 1876 to 1887, when it was replaced by a railroad.
The Rawhide Buttes station was demolished in 1973 after having functioned as a ranch headquarters. The ruin of the stage station barn is the only remnant of the Running Water Station, which stood about 15 miles (24 km) north of Rawhide Butte near the stage route's intersection with the Texas Trail. Running Water saw a minor mining boom during the 1880s, but was superseded by Lusk.
The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.
