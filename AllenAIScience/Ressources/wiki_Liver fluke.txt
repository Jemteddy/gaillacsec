Liver flukes are parasites. They are a polyphyletic group of trematodes (phylum Platyhelminthes). Adults of liver flukes are localized in the liver of various mammals, including humans. These flatworms can occur in bile ducts, gallbladder, and liver parenchyma. They feed on blood. Adult flukes produce eggs which are passed into the intestine. It depends on two intermediate hosts (a snail and a fish) to complete its life cycle.
Examples include:
Clonorchis sinensis (the "Chinese liver fluke" or the "Oriental liver fluke")
Dicrocoelium dendriticum (lancet liver fluke)
Dicrocoelium hospes
Fasciola hepatica (the "sheep liver fluke")
Fascioloides magna (the "giant liver fluke")
Fasciola gigantica
Fasciola jacksoni
Metorchis conjunctus
Metorchis albidus
Protofasciola robusta
Parafasciolopsis fasciomorphae
Opisthorchis viverrini (Southeast Asian liver fluke)
