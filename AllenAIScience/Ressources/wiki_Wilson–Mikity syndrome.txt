Wilson–Mikity syndrome, also known as pulmonary dysmaturity syndrome, is a rare lung condition that affects low birth weight babies.
It is closely related to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, differing mainly in the lack of prior ventilatory support. All the initial patients described with Wilson–Mikity syndrome were very low birth weight infants that had no history of mechanical ventilation and yet developed a syndrome that clinically resembled BPD. Upon the death of some of these infants, autopsies showed histologic changes also similar to those seen in BPD.


== HistoryEdit ==
It was characterized by Miriam G. Wilson and Victor G. Mikity in 1960.
