Oxo alcohols are alcohols that are prepared by adding carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (usually combined together as synthesis gas) to an olefin to obtain an aldehyde using the hydroformylation reaction and then hydrogenating the aldehyde to obtain the alcohol. An intermediate step of adding two aldehydes together to obtain a larger aldehyde (the aldol condensation reaction) can precede the hydrogenation.
Key oxo alcohols that are sold in commerce include the following:
2-Methyl-2-butanol (2M2B)
n-Butanol
2-Ethylhexanol
Isononyl alcohol
Isodecyl alcohol
Key manufacturers of oxo alcohols include the following companies:
BASF
Dow Chemical Company
Eastman Chemical Company
ExxonMobil Chemical Company
Oxo alcohols are used as solvents and are reacted with phthalic anhydride to form phthalates, which find use in commerce as vinyl plasticizers.
