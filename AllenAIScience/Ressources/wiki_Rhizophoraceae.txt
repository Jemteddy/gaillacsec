Rhizophoraceae is a family constituted by tropical or subtropical flowering plants. Among the better-known members are mangrove trees of the genus Rhizophora. There are around 149 species distributed in sixteen genera, most native to the Old World.
These are woody plants with opposite or whorled leaves (but not decussate), with insect-pollinated flowers having a nectary disc and typically five petals. This family is now placed in the order Malpighiales, though under the Cronquist system they formed an order in themselves (Rhizophorales).
These species are often hermaphrodite, more rarely polygamomonoecious. Mangrove species are usually viviparous while those living on land are not.


== Uses ==
Some species produce wood used for underwater construction or piling. Tannins are obtained from the tree's bark.
