Advanced Compatibility Engineering (commonly called ACE Body Structure) is the marketing name given to an automobile body structure design from Honda. It claims to distribute collision energy evenly and redirect it away from the passenger compartment, while at the same time, minimizing damage to other impacted vehicles. This is accomplished by using numerous grades of steel (typically four) which crumple in key areas and remain rigid in others. It is standard on all Honda and Acura models as of 2012, except for the Ridgeline.
