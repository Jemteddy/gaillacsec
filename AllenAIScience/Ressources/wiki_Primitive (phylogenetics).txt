Primitive in phylogenetics means a character, trait or feature of a lineage or taxon that is inherited from a common ancestor and has undergone little change since. A primitive trait is the original condition of the character in a clade. A trait that appears within a clade (i.e. is present in some groups within a clade but not all) is called advanced. These terms in biology contain no judgement about the sophistication, superiority, value or adaptiveness of a trait. "Primitive" in biology means only that the trait appeared first in the ancestor of a group and has been passed on largely intact to more recent members. "Advanced" means the trait evolved within the group.


== Primitiveness of characters is determined by context ==
Primitive and advanced are relative terms. When a trait is called "primitive", the determination is based on the perspective from which the trait is viewed. Any trait can be both primitive (ancestral) and advanced depending on the context in which it is considered.


=== Examples ===
In the clade of vertebrates, legs are an advanced trait since it is a feature that appears in the clade. However, in the clade of tetrapods, legs are primitive since they were inherited from a common ancestor.


== Species cannot be primitive ==
The term primitive (or advanced/derived) is not properly used in reference to an organism or species as every species is a mosaic of primitive and derived traits. Humans, for example have large brains (a derived trait) and five fingers (a primitive trait) in their lineage. Species are constantly evolving, so a frog is not biologically more primitive than a human as each has been evolving continuously since each lineage split from their common ancestor.


== Usage ==
Several other sets of terms are synonymous with primitive (and advanced) in phylogenetics. These terms are considered preferable as they are less likely to convey the sense that some traits are inferior, less adaptive or even simpler. The terms plesiomorphy and apomorphy are used in the technical literature. When a plesiomorphic trait is shared by more than one member of a clade, the trait is called a "symplesiomorphy", i.e. a shared primitive trait. A shared derived trait is a "synapomorphy".
