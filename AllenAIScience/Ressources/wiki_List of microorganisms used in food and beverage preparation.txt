This is an incomplete list of bacteria and fungi that are used in preparing food. Do not include species which are only involved in food spoilage. For the first column, always use the most up-to-date name for the microorganism (e.g. "Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii", not the older name "Propionibacterium shermanii"). For the food column, be as specific as possible (e.g. "cheese" or "yogurt" instead of "dairy" or "Emmental cheese" instead of "cheese"). Also, for each food create a new row so that the food column can be fully sortable. Whenever possible, cite your sources.
