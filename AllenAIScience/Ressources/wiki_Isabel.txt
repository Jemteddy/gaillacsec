Isabel (/ˈɪz.ə.bɛl/) is a Romance-language given name. It is related to Isabelle (French, Dutch, German, Catalan, Provençal), Isabella (Italian), and the English Elizabeth.


== EtymologyEdit ==
This set of names is a southwestern European variant of the Hebrew name Elisheva, also represented in English and other western languages as Elizabeth. It first appeared in medieval Provençal as Elisabel. Guido Gómez de Silva states that these names are derived from the Latin and Greek renderings of the Hebrew name based on both etymological and contextual evidence (the use of Isabel as a translation of the name of the mother of John the Baptist).
The variant form originated through the loss of the first syllable and the replacement of final /t/ with /l/ (as /t/ does not appear word-finally in standard Spanish). Both forms of the name exist concurrently in Italian (Isabella and Elisabetta) and French (Isabelle and Élisabeth). Both names have been borrowed into multiple other languages, giving rise to various local forms.
