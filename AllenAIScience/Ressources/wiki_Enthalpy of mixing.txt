The enthalpy of mixing (also called heat of mixing) is the heat that is taken up or released upon mixing of two (non-reacting) chemical substances. When the enthalpy of mixing is positive, mixing is endothermic while negative enthalpy of mixing signifies exothermic mixing. In ideal mixtures the enthalpy of mixing is null. In non-ideal mixtures the thermodynamic activity of each component is different from its concentration by multiplying with the activity coefficient.
A well-known approximation for calculating the heat of mixing is Floryâ€“Huggins solution theory for polymer solutions.
