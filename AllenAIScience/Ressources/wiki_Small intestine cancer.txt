In oncology, small intestine cancer, also small bowel cancer and cancer of the small bowel, is a cancer of the small intestine. It is relatively rare compared to other gastrointestinal malignancies such as gastric cancer (stomach cancer) and colorectal cancer.
Small intestine cancer can be subdivided into duodenal cancer (the first part of the small intestine) and cancer of the jejunum and ileum (the later two parts of the small intestine). Duodenal cancer has more in common with stomach cancer, while cancer of the jejunum and ileum have more in common with colorectal cancer. Five year survival rates are 65%.
Several different subtypes of small intestine cancer exist. These include:
adenocarcinoma
gastrointestinal stromal tumor
lymphoma
ileal carcinoid tumor


== Risk factors ==

Risk factors for small intestine cancer include:
Crohn's disease
Celiac disease
Radiation exposure
Hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes: familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
Males are 25% more likely to develop the disease
Benign tumours and conditions that may be mistaken for cancer of the small bowel:
Hamartoma
Tuberculosis


== Research ==
Little research is conducted on these cancers due to their relative rarity when compared to the more common colorectal cancers. APC-min mice which carry a gene deficiency corresponding to that of humans with FAP also go on to develop small intestinal tumors, though humans do not.
