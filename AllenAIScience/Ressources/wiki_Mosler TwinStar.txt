The Mosler TwinStar was an automobile developed by Mosler Automotive in 2000. The vehicle was essentially a Cadillac Eldorado that had been modified to fit two Northstar V8 engines. One engine remained in the factory-equipped location underneath the hood and another was located in what was formerly the vehicle's trunk.
Each engine was capable of making 300 horsepower (225 kW) and was connected to the nearest axle, creating an all-wheel drive (AWD) layout.
