It appears in the backstager Warner Brothers musical film 42nd Street.

== Parodies ==
Allan Sherman recorded "You're getting to be a Rabbit with Me" on his 1963 album My Son, the Nut.
On the South Park season eight episode "You Got F'd in the A", the song Butters danced to in the flashback of the freak accident caused by his tap dancing was an upbeat (yet risqué) tune of "I've Got Something in My Front Pocket For You", which sounds similar to this song in tune (and song title).
This music plays in the BioShock Launch Trailer.
This song was also featured in the film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, as Duke enters the police convention at the hotel for the first time.
