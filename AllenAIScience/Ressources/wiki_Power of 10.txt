In mathematics, a power of 10 is any of the integer powers of the number ten; in other words, ten multiplied by itself a certain number of times (when the power is a positive integer). By definition, the number one is a power (the zeroth power) of ten. The first few non-negative powers of ten are:
1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000. ... (sequence A011557 in OEIS)


== Positive powers ==
In decimal notation the nth power of ten is written as '1' followed by n zeroes. It can also be written as 10n or as 1En in E notation. See order of magnitude and orders of magnitude (numbers) for named powers of ten. There are two conventions for naming positive powers of ten, called the long and short scales. Where a power of ten has different names in the two conventions, the long scale name is shown in brackets.


== Negative powers ==
The sequence of powers of ten can also be extended to negative powers:


== Googol ==

The number googol is 10100. The term was coined by 9-year-old Milton Sirotta, nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner, popularized in his 1940 book Mathematics and the Imagination, it was used to compare and illustrate very large numbers. Googolplex, a much larger power of ten (10 to the googol power, or 1010100), was also introduced in that book.
The name of this power of ten inspired the name of the company Google.


== Scientific notation ==

Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers of very large and very small sizes compactly when precision is less important.
A number written in scientific notation has a significand (sometime called a mantissa) multiplied by a power of ten.
Sometimes written in the form:
m × 10n
Or more compactly as:
10n
This is generally used to denote powers of 10. Where n is positive, this indicates the number zeros after the number, and where the n is negative, this indicates the number of decimal place before the number.
As an example:
105 = 100,000
10−5 = 0.00001
The notation of mEn, known as E notation, is used in computer programming, spreadsheets and databases, but is not used in scientific papers.
