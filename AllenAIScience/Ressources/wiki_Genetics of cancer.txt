Cancer is a genetic disorder in which the normal control of cell growth is lost. Cancer genetics is now one of the fastest expanding medical specialties. At the molecular level, cancer is caused by mutation(s) in DNA, which result in aberrant cell proliferation. Most of these mutations are acquired and occur in somatic cells. However, some people inherit mutation(s) in the germline. The mutation(s) occur in two classes of cellular genes: oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
Transformation of proto-oncogene to oncogene is the result of gain in function through:
Over-expression of the gene, or duplication (such as amplification) to produce increased onco-protein
Activation or formation of fusion gene by translocation
Alteration of the gene product to produce transforming proteins


== Examples of Oncogenes ==
Signal transduction proteins:
Abl
Src
H-ras
N-ras

Nuclear DNA binding protein:
Myc
N-Myc

Secreted growth factors:
Sis

Growth factors cell-surface receptors:
Erb-A


== Tumor suppressor genes ==

Under normal conditions, tumor suppressor genes regulate cellular differentiation and suppression of proliferation. Mutations in these genes result in unchecked cellular proliferation resulting in tumors with abnormal cell cycles and tumor proliferation. The tumor suppressor genes contribute to cancer by the inactivating of loss of function mutation.

== DNA repair genes ==
DNA damage does occur in cells and if not repaired, can result in mutations. DNA repair genes code for enzymes that are responsible for fixing these damages. Inability to fix these damages often results in genome instability where mutations accumulate and get passed down to daughter cells. These mutations may disrupt the proper function of cell division, namely the genes that control the cell cycle, which promotes tumor development. Increasing evidence suggests mutations in these genes that regulate recognition and repair of DNA damage are critical in tumorigenesis. DNA repair genes are often affected by loss of function mutations.
