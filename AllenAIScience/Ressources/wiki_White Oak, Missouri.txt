White Oak is an unincorporated community in Dunklin County, Missouri, United States. It is located on Route 25 about five miles north of Kennett. White Oak is now quite different than when I often visited my friends and my Uncle and Aunt who lived there. It has a small and the only natural river stream in the entire area. My Uncle, myself and my good friend who lived there often caught many good catfish there. There was a store there, a cotton gin across the hiway, many wonderful memories. The farmers have now drained the water level down so low that the stream is now dry and that is sad. Many years ago Indians populated the whole area, as a young boy I often found many artifacts from the Indian culture that must have lived there for centuries. It is sad that most of their artifacts have now been plowed up into shards, just broken pottery and an occasional arrow head. So much could have been learned if we would have been more interested in there culture than cotton, soy been and wheat. ==History== White Oak was named after the species Quercus alba.
