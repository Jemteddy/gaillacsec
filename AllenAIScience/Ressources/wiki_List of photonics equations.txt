This article summarizes equations in the theory of photonics, including geometric optics, physical optics, radiometry, diffraction, and interferometry.


== DefinitionsEdit ==


=== Geometric optics (luminal rays)Edit ===


==== General fundamental quantitiesEdit ====


=== Physical optics (EM luminal waves)Edit ===

There are different forms of the Poynting vector, the most common are in terms of the E and B or E and H fields.


=== RadiometryEdit ===

For spectral quantities two definitions are in use to refer to the same quantity, in terms of frequency or wavelength.


== EquationsEdit ==


=== Luminal electromagnetic wavesEdit ===


=== Geometric opticsEdit ===

Subscripts 1 and 2 refer to initial and final optical media respectively.
These ratios are sometimes also used, following simply from other definitions of refractive index, wave phase velocity, and the luminal speed equation:

where:


=== PolarizationEdit ===


=== Diffraction and interferenceEdit ===


== Astrophysics definitionsEdit ==
In astrophysics, L is used for luminosity (energy per unit time, equivalent to power) and F is used for energy flux (energy per unit time per unit area, equivalent to intensity in terms of area, not solid angle). They are not new quantities, simply different names.
