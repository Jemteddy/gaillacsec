Collagen alpha-2(I) chain is a protein that in humans is encoded by the COL1A2 gene.
This gene encodes one of the chains for type I collagen, the fibrillar collagen found in most connective tissues. Mutations in this gene are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, idiopathic osteoporosis, and atypical Marfan syndrome. Symptoms associated with mutations in this gene, however, tend to be less severe than mutations in the gene for alpha-1 type I collagen since alpha-2 is less abundant. Multiple messages for this gene result from multiple polyadenylation signals, a feature shared by most of the other collagen genes.
