Archer Avenue runs from south of Chicago's downtown area through the southwest side of Chicago and beyond into the southwest suburbs. The street is built along was once a Native American trail. Development was attempted in the area multiple times; however, the lack of water, electricity and other services hindered development despite the existence of horse-drawn streetcar service as early as 1896. In 1912, a subdivision named Archer Heights was built in this area. The name Archer Heights comes from the major arterial, as well as a ridge on the southern end of Mud Lake.
