The Himmler-Kersten Agreement was a document signed on 12 March 1945 by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler and his personal physician Felix Kersten, in which Himmler made four pledges 'in the name of humanity' concerning the fate of Nazi concentration camps upon the approach of Allied forces at the end of the Second World War.
The four points of the agreement were that on the approach of Allied forces:
The concentration camps would not be destroyed
A white flag would be flown and control of concentration camps handed over to the Allies
The killing of Jews would be ceased and Jews treated equally to other prisoners
The inmates would not be evacuated and Sweden would be allowed to send food parcels to individual Jewish prisoners
The document was signed in secret, in the presence only of SS physician Karl Brandt, in a room at the SS Sanatorium in Hohenlychen.
