Aquapel is a rain repellent glass treatment created by PPG Industries. It is a competitor to the more widely known Rain-X product, but unlike Rain-X, is not a silicone-based compound. Aquapel Glass Treatment consists of fluorinated compounds which create a chemical bond with glass surfaces, causing water to bead up and roll off. Because of this chemical bond with glass, Aquapel is reported to last much longer than silicone-based rain repellents.
