The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (IEEE RAS) is a professional society of the IEEE.


== History ==
The initial IEEE Robotics and Automation (R&A) entity, the Robotics and Automation Council, was founded in 1984 by a number of IEEE Societies including Aerospace and Electronic Systems, Circuits and Systems, Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology, Computers, Control Systems, Industrial Electronics, Industry Applications, and Systems, Man and Cybernetics. In 1987 the council became the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society.


== Field of interest ==
The Society states in its constitution that it "is interested in both applied and theoretical issues in robotics and automation. Robotics is here defined to include intelligent machines and systems used, for example, in space exploration, human services, or manufacturing; whereas automation includes the use of automated methods in various applications, for example, factory, office, home, or transportation systems to improve performance and productivity."


== Publications ==
The society publishes a range of peer-reviewed journals, including
IEEE Transactions on Robotics
IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering
IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine
Co-sponsored publications include:
IEEE/ASME MicroElectroMechancial Systems Journal (MEMS)
IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics
IEEE Transactions on Haptics
IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing
IEEE Transactions on Nanoâ€“Bio Science
