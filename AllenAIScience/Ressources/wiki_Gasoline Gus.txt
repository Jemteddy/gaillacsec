Gasoline Gus is an early 20th century popular culture figure who also appeared in cartoon strips and a record single, both of which precede the film. The comic strip was written by O.P. Williams and was syndicated by the Philadelphia North American between 1913 and 1914. Gasoline Gus was a taxi driver and car fanatic who constantly wrecked his early automobile. Billy Murray and the American Quartet recorded the song "Gasoline Gus and his Jitney Bus" in 1915.
