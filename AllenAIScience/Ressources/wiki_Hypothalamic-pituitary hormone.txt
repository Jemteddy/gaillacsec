Hypothalamic-pituitary hormones are hormones that are produced by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Although the organs in which they are produced are relatively small, the effects of these hormones cascade throughout the body. They can be classified as a hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HP axis) of which the HPA, HPG, and HPT axes are branches.
It is possible for the function of these hormones to be altered by physical activity.
