Libore is a rural commune in Niger comprising approximately 40 villages. Located along the left bank of the Niger river 20 kilometers to the southeast of the capital, Niamey, its economy is based predominantly on the subsistence cultivation of irrigated rice and rainfed millet. Other crops include hot pepper, okra, tomato, and lettuce, while several species of mango are grown and marketed. Villages are predominantly of the Zarma or Djerma ethnicity though Fula (French: Peul; Fula: Ful…ìe) villages are scattered throughout. While the Zarmas are primarily agriculturalists and Fulas mainly herders, both groups dabble in each other's traditional livelihoods.
Libore has 36 primary schools and 2 high schools. Because of its proximity to the capital, the commune experiences a higher rate of non-agricultural employment than the Nigerien average. The weekly market takes place on Mondays in the village of Tchandifarou. The commune's community NGO, ONG LIBO, directed by Hamani Djibo, is involved in education, health services, and commercial development.
