Life Becoming a Landslide E.P. is an EP by the alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. The title track is taken from their second album Gold Against the Soul. It remains an important insight into the mindset of the band's lyricist/guitarist Richey Edwards, and a poignant exploration of the metamorphosis of child and adult roles. Certain lines in the song, such as My idea of love comes from a childhood glimpse of pornography, exemplify this. It could also be seen as a precursor to the fully orchestrated, epic sound the band would adopt after Edwards' disappearance, ironically precluded by the aggressive guitar sound of the seminal The Holy Bible album. The EP is noted for its b-side Comfort Comes: the first Manics track to explore the raw, claustrophobic, cold yet impassioned aesthetic which would be illustrated on The Holy Bible. The release reached #36 in the UK charts in February 1994.
