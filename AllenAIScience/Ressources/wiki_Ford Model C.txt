The Ford Model C was a version of the first Ford Model A with a more modern look introduced in 1904. It was built at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant. It had a slightly more powerful engine and 15 cm (6 inches) longer wheelbase. It was the entry-level car in the Ford model lineup, slotting below the upscale Model B. Production ended in 1905 with 800 cars made. The Model C was replaced by the derivative Model F in 1905.
Both Models A and C were produced at the same time, but the Model A could also be bought with a Model C engine, an option called Ford Model AC. The Model C engine was a flat-2 giving 8 hp (6 kW) at first and 10 hp (7 kW) by 1905 with a claimed top speed of 38 mph. Ford's entry level Model C two-seater was marketed as a 'Doctor's Car' and sold for only $850 (equivalent to $22000 today), with the option of making it a four-seater for an extra $100. The top cost extra, rubber for $30 and leather for $50.
Although the Model C had a protruding front "box" like a modern car, unlike the flat-front Model A, this was purely ornamental — the engine remained under the seat (the gas tank was what was under the hood).
The Model C was the first vehicle to be built at Ford Motor Company of Canada.
