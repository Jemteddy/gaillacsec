Tribeca Interactive was a computer game production company owned by actor Robert De Niro. It produced an expensive, technically advanced product called 9. It was, however, a commercial failure and the company did not release any follow-up projects.
Tribeca Interactive is often confused with Tribeca Digital Studios, the producers of Shadow: War of Succession, which was released through 3DO and met with bad reviews. Tribeca Digital Studios was not affiliated with De Niro though it leased office space in De Niro's Tribeca building.
