The 1985 Meath Intermediate Football Championship is the 59th edition of the Meath GAA's premier club Gaelic football tournament for intermediate graded teams in County Meath, Ireland. The tournament consists of 18 teams. The championship starts with a group stage and then progresses to a knock out stage.
This was Rathkenny's return to the grade after a 2 year absence as they were promoted after claiming the 1984 Meath Junior Football Championship title. They were previously relegated from the I.F.C. in 1983 under the name Grove Emmets.
This was Gaeil Colmcille's first time ever in the middle grade as they had spent 21 years in the top flight of Meath football since being founded in 1964 from the Kells parish clubs of Kells Harps, Kilmainham and Drumbaragh. Martinstown/Athboy returned to the I.F.C. 5 years of playing senior football.
On 3 November 1985, Martry Harps claimed their 1st Intermediate championship title when they defeated St. Mary's Donore 1-8 to 1-2 in a final replay.
Moylagh were relegated to the J.F.C. and hence ending their 8 year stay in the middle grade since being regraded from the S.F.C. in 1977. They previously won an I.F.C. title in 1975 and reached two finals in 1971 and 1973.
