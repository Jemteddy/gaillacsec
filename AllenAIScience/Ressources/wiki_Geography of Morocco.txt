Morocco spans from the Atlantic Ocean, to mountainous areas, to the Sahara desert. Morocco is a Northern African country, located in the extreme north west of Africa on the door of continental Europe. The strait of Gibraltar separates Spain and Morocco with a 13 km span of water. Morocco borders the North Atlantic Ocean to the west and the west Mediterranean Sea to the north.
The largest part of Morocco is mountainous. The Atlas Mountains are located mainly in the center and the south. It expands to more than 1100 km and is the dorsal spine of the country. To the north, we have the Rif Mountains, which are part of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in Andalusia, Spain. The massive range expands to 360 km from Tangier in the west to the foot of Saïdia eastward.
To the west of the country, along the Atlantic coast, rich coastal plains stretch from Tangier to Agadir, about 800 km long, and get inward to Saiss Plains near Fes and Tansift-Alhaouz around the city of Marrakech. These vast plains promotes fertile agricultural lands and make one of the most important economical resources of Morocco.
In the extreme South-East of the country, the lands are usually arid, due to their proximity to the Sahara desert of Algeria. Palm trees oasis are developed in many regions, notably in Figuig and Zagora.

== ClimateEdit ==
If we exclude the extreme South-East regions, which classifies as arid, Morocco's climate in general is similar to the one you find in the Iberian Peninsula with its all sub-climatic diversity. Thus, we find the following zones:
Mediterranean: This climate is found along the Mediterranean coast of the country, and parts of the Northern Atlantic portion between Tangier and Kénitra. From Kénitra downward, the typical Mediterranean climate becomes more Oceanic influenced reaching up to Essaouira region, where it becomes typically Oceanic but with less rainfall than found in Oceanic zones like in Western France or the UK.
Continental: This climate is found in large parts of the RiF, Middle-Atlas and the Norther side of the High-Atlas Mountains, cities like Fes or Meknes, who lies on the periphery of these mountains range are also influenced by continental climate but remain essentially Mediterranean.
Semi-arid: This climate is found south of the city of Essaouira, where yearly average precipitations start to get below 400 mm, and that what prevents cities like Agadir or Marrakech from being classified as Mediterranean, despite the similitude in yearly temperatures and rainfall pattern (November-April).
The disputed Western Sahara region features a hot desert climate, but temperatures are more moderate along the coast.


== Physical geographyEdit ==
Terrain: Northern coast and interior are mountainous with large areas of bordering plateaus, intermontane valleys, and rich coastal plains

== Extreme pointsEdit ==
This is a list of the extreme points of Morocco, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location (excluding the disputed Western Sahara area).
Northernmost point – Punta Cires, Tangier-Tétouan region
Easternmost point – unnamed point on the border with Algeria immediately east of the town of Iche, Oriental region
Southernmost point – the border with Western Sahara, Guelmim-Es Semara region*
Westernmost point - the point at which the border with Western Sahara enters the Atlantic Ocean, Guelmim-Es Semara region
Note: Morocco does not have a southern-most point, the border being formed by a straight horizontal line
