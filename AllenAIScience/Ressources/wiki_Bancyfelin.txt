Bancyfelin is a village, 5 miles (8.0 km) west of Carmarthen in West Wales.
Bancyfelin is a small village in south west Wales located between St Clears and Carmarthen. The English translation of the name from the Welsh language is Hill of the Mill / "Millhill"(Banc-y-felin). There is no remnant of the mill today.
Up until the 1980s the village was plagued by traffic jams in the summer months due to holidaymakers journeying to Tenby and Pendine Sands, however, a new dual carriageway bypass means traffic passes the village.
The village is located mainly on the old A40 road, with the exception of the Council Estate built on a nearby hill. The village has gradually expanded through the 1990s and 2000s with the building of houses on the outskirts taking advantage of the countryside location.
The village has a small primary school, a post office, a pub, a chapel and a garage. Bancyfelin also has a family run bakery called Hafod Bakery, which has been baking bread for around 60 years.
Werndale Hospital, run by BMI Healthcare, is located at the western end of the village.
