NGC 4874 (Coma A) is a supergiant elliptical galaxy. It was discovered by the British astronomer Frederick William Herschel I in 1785, who catalogued it as a bright patch of nebulous feature. The second brightest galaxy within the northern Coma Cluster, it is located at a distance of 109 megaparsecs (350 million light years) from Earth. Unlike a disc-shaped spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, NGC 4874 has no extensive dust lanes or spiral arms and has a smooth, featureless, ball-shaped profile that diminishes in luminosity with distance from the center. The galaxy is surrounded by an immense stellar halo that extends up to 1 million light years in diameter. It is also enveloped by a huge cloud of interstellar medium that is currently being heated by action of infalling material from its central supermassive black hole. A jet of highly energetic plasma extends out to 1,700 light years from its center.
