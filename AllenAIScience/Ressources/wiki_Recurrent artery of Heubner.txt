Heubner's artery (also known as the recurrent artery of Heubner or Medial Striate A.), named after the German paediatrician Otto Heubner is a branch from the anterior cerebral artery, typically from the proximal A2 segment or distal A1 segment, or at the level of the optic chiasm. Its vascular territory is the anteromedial section of the caudate nucleus and the anterioinferior section of the internal capsule, as well as parts of the putamen and septal nuclei. Heubner's artery is the distal part of the medial striate artery.
In cases of obstructed flow in the Heubner's artery, the individual may experience infarction in those subcortical areas and thus hemiparesis. More proximal portions of the medial striate artery may cause spastic paraparesis and sensory loss contralateral to the lesioned side. Urinary incontinence and gait apraxia are also not uncommon findings.
Of note, occlusive damage to the medial striate artery may also present with contralateral grip reflex issues, and symptoms of Dysexecutive Syndrome. Contralateral gaze preference with or without transcortical motor aphasia may present in instances where the left hemisphere is affected in this type of occlusion.
