2160p is an alternative name for 4K UHD, a resolution supported by UHDTV products and which offers four times the definition of 1080p. The number 2160 stands for a display resolution which has 2160 pixels along the shortest side, while the letter p stands for progressive scan or non-interlaced. In a progressive image, the lines of resolution of the image go from the top of the screen to the bottom. The only planned higher definition format for television is 8K UHD.


== OverviewEdit ==
2160p or 4K UHD is 3840Ã—2160 (8.3 megapixels in the 16:9 aspect ratio) and is one of the two resolutions of Ultra-high-definition television.


== Confusion between QHD and UHDEdit ==
QuadHD or QHD are in fact only 1440p not this higher 2160p (UHD) standard. Quad HD is four times the resolution of HD or 'HD Ready' (720p), whereas UHD is four times the resolution of Full HD (1080p).
