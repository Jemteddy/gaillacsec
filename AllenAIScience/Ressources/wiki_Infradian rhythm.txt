An infradian rhythm is a rhythm with a period longer than the period of a circadian rhythm, i.e. with a frequency less than one cycle in 28 hours, such as menstruation, breeding, tidal or seasonal rhythms. In contrast, ultradian refers to rhythms with periods shorter than the period of a circadian rhythm.
