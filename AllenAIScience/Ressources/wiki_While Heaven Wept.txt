While Heaven Wept (often abbreviated as WHW) is an epic doom metal band based in Dale City, Virginia, USA. The primary writer and overall engine of the band is mainman Tom Phillips. Their melodic, classically influenced style could be compared to bands such as Solitude Aeturnus and Solstice (the latter of which Tom Phillips is a former member); however, 2003's acclaimed Of Empires Forlorn saw the band branching out into a variety of metal and progressive styles. This trend continues on their 2009 album, Vast Oceans Lachrymose, and on their 2011 album, "Fear of Infinity".
While Heaven Wept's lyrics have traditionally dealt with sorrowful matters, namely, personal loss and despondency.
While Heaven Wept announced on their Facebook page that they are currently planning on a 2014 release in autumn. The album will consist of a single 40 minute epic track.
