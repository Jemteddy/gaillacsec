"Fri?" ("Free?") was the Finnish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1990, performed in Swedish (the first occasion that this language had been used in preference to Finnish) by Beat.
The song was performed 22nd (last) on the night, following Cyprus' Haris Anastasiou with "Milas Poli". At the close of voting, it had received 8 points, placing 21st in a field of 22.
The song consists of the band asking the question "which of us are free?" and defining this freedom as "free to think for ourselves". While no answer is ever given, the lyrics strongly imply that nobody experiences this freedom. Beat also recorded the song in Finnish and English, then under the titles "Vapaa?" and "Free" respectively.
It was succeeded as Finnish representative at the 1991 Contest by Kaija with "Hullu y√∂".
