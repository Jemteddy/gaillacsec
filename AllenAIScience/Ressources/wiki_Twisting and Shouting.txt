Twisting and Shouting is the 3rd album released by The Isley Brothers in 1963, credited as The Famous Isley Brothers, on the United Artitsts label. Their third album after Twist & Shout one year prior, the album was released with none of the songs making the singles chart, and preceded a three-year gap before the brothers' next album (This Old Heart of Mine), which would see them move to Berry Gordy's Motown label. In 1991, the album was reissued on CD with extra tracks and retitled The Complete UA Sessions.
