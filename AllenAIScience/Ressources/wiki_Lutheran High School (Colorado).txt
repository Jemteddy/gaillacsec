== History ==
In 1955, Lutheran High School opened on West Arizona Avenue in Denver, CO. Only temporary buildings, including a little, white house, which is still on campus today, served as the classrooms and school library. Total enrollment the first year was 77 students - 49 freshmen and 28 sophomores. Students voted to have navy blue and gold as the school colors and choose to have The Lights as the mascot. In 2000, the school decided to expand to two additional campuses - Lutheran High School of the Rockies (later renamed Lutheran High School Parker) and North Lutheran High School. Lutheran High was renamed Denver Lutheran (DL) because of the additional campuses.
Lutheran High School Parker opened in 2000 in a strip mall on Parker Road. In 2004, construction for Lutheran High School Parker started at its current location on Newlin Gulch. Construction was completed in 2008. Enrollment goals for each campus couldn’t be met for several years, resulting in North Lutheran High closing in 2006. The lack of success also resulted in Denver Lutheran closing its doors in 2011 and being consolidated with Lutheran High School Parker. The consolidation of Denver and Parker Lutheran led to yet another name change - Lutheran High School (LHS). Lutheran High School is now the only Lutheran high school in the Denver metro area. Today, enrollment is 400.
