Olfactophilia or osmolagnia is a paraphilia for, or sexual arousal by, smells and odors emanating from the body, especially the sexual areas. Etymologies: olfactophilia (Latin=olfacto, to smell, pertaining to the sense of smell, and Greek=philia, love); osmolagnia (Greek=osme, smell, and lagneia, lust).
Sigmund Freud used the term osphresiolagnia in reference to pleasure caused by odors.
Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary includes them into parosmias, disturbances of the sense of smell.
