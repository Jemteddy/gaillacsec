Paper splitting is a method of preserving brittle papers often found in library and archival materials. In this process the front and back of a sheet of paper are split apart. A piece of acid-free paper is placed between these two sides of an acidic sheet before the pages are reconnected. The intention is to reduce the acid deterioration in the paper. A paper-splitting machine has been developed, but is not in wide use.
