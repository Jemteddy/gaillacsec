Yuri Valeryevich Baskakov (Russian: Юрий Валерьевич Баскаков; born May 10, 1964 in Moscow) is a former Russian football referee. He refereed games in Champions League and the Russian Premier League.
He controversially oversaw the Champions League quarter-final in 2007 between Bayern Munich and AC Milan over the objections of the German club [1], who believed that they had suffered against Milan the previous year because of another Russian, Valentin Ivanov's refereeing. Baskakov, according to Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, was too inexperienced to manage the pressure-cooker environment of San Siro. The match itself seemed to reflect Rummenigge's concerns, as Baskakov awarded a dubious penalty to Kaká after a challenge from Lucio[2]. Kaká converted the penalty to put Milan ahead.
