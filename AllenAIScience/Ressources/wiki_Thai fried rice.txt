Thai fried rice (Thai: ข้าวผัด, rtgs: khao phat, pronounced [kʰâːw pʰàt] or  [kʰâw pʰàt]) is a variety of fried rice typical of central Thai cuisine. In Thai, khao means "rice" and phat means "of or relating to being stir-fried". This dish differs from Chinese fried rice in that it is prepared with Thai jasmine rice instead of regular long-grain rice. It normally contains meat (chicken, shrimp, and crab are all common), egg, onions, garlic and sometimes tomatoes. The seasonings, which may include soy sauce, sugar, salt, possibly some chili sauce, and the ubiquitous nam pla (fish sauce), are stir-fried together with the other ingredients. The dish is then plated and served with accompaniments like cucumber slices, tomato slices, lime and sprigs of green onion and coriander. This dish has many regional variants, as it is ubiquitous.
Other dishes include coconut fried rice (Thai: ข้าวผัดมะพร้าว, khao phat maphrao), pineapple fried rice (Thai: ข้าวผัดสับปะรด, khao phat sapparot) and basil fried rice (Thai: ข้าวผัดกะเพรา, khao phat kaphrao). Khao op sapparot is a fancier fried rice pineapple dish with raisins and nuts and almost always comes served inside a cutout pineapple.
