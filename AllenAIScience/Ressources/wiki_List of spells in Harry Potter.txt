Spells in Harry Potter occur in the fictional wizarding world of the series of books by author J. K. Rowling. Magic spells are used by many of the characters to achieve useful effects without the benefit of modern technology. The main depiction of a "spell" in the Harry Potter books consists of a gesture made with the character's wand, combined with a spoken or mental incantation. In the books and the associated film series, the names of the majority of these spells or the incantations used to effect them are derived from the classical languages, particularly Latin. These names are not grammatically correct in any language; most spoken phrases resemble Latin words of appropriate meaning but are not proper Latin themselves.


== Spells ==
Spells are listed here by their incantations (when known), with their vernacular names in parentheses. Some spells have no known incantation – the only reference in the text is by an informal name, either because in its only appearance in the relevant book it was cast nonverbally, or because it was never depicted in the books, only mentioned. The majority of spells cast in duels between adult characters in all seven books appear nonverbally; only their effects can identify such spells.

=== Accio (Summoning Charm) ===
Pronunciation: Various suggestions have been made, including:
/ˈæki.oʊ/ AK-ee-oh – film
/ˈæksi.oʊ/ AK-see-oh – UK audio book and video game
/ˈæsi.oʊ/ AS-see-oh – U.S. audio book
/ˈætʃi.oʊ/ AT-chee-oh – Anglo-Catholic pronunciation

Description: This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance. Its opposite is the Banishing Charm.
Seen/mentioned: First mentioned in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, when it was briefly used by Molly Weasley on the Weasley twins to confiscate their Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes' products from their pockets, before they left for the Quidditch World Cup. Hermione was also mentioned trying to learn this charm during her ride aboard the Hogwarts Express. Later on in the same book, Harry summons his broom to complete the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament.[GF Ch.20] Near the end of the book, Harry uses it to summon the Triwizard Cup after he encounters Voldemort.

Harry uses this spell to summon Hagrid in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows but fails.

Seen/mentioned: First seen in Goblet of Fire, when Fleur put the fire out on her skirt "with a bit of water from her wand." First named in Half-Blood Prince, when Harry is being taught how to perform this specific charm in Professor Flitwick's class. Later Harry casts this spell in an attempt to create water for Dumbledore to drink after taking Voldemort's potion[HBP Ch.26], and again to douse Hagrid's hut after it is set on fire.[HBP Ch.28][DH Ch.31].


=== Alohomora ===
Pronunciation: /əˌloʊhəˈmɔərə/ ə-LOH-hə-MOHR-ə
Description: Used to open and/or unlock doors, but doors can be bewitched so that this spell has no effect.[PS Ch.16]
Seen/mentioned: Used throughout the series, with the first use by Hermione in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Used gradually less in the series as the characters discover more and more doors, chests, etc. with counter-charms on them. For example, the doors into Professor Snape's and Professor Umbridge's offices are mentioned as being Alohomora-proof.
Notes: J. K. Rowling stated that the word was from the West African Sidiki dialect used in geomancy and has the literal meaning Friendly to thieves.


=== Anapneo ===
Pronunciation: /əˈnæpniː.oʊ/ ə-NAP-nee-oh
Description: Clears the target's airway, if blocked.
Seen/mentioned: Shown in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Horace Slughorn casts this spell on Marcus Belby when the latter begins to choke.[HBP Ch.7]

Seen/mentioned: Mentioned in Order of the Phoenix, used by Dumbledore to trap several Death Eaters in the Department of Mysteries.[OotP Ch.36] Also cast long ago on Hogwarts, the reason why, as Hermione quotes often throughout the series, "no one can Apparate or Disapparate inside the Hogwarts grounds."


=== Aparecium ===
Pronunciation: /ˌæpəˈriːsi.əm/ AP-ə-REE-see-əm
Description: This spell makes invisible ink appear.
Seen/mentioned: First seen in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, when Hermione tries to make hidden writing appear in Tom Marvolo Riddle's diary.[CS Ch.13]
Notes: See also Specialis Revelio.


=== Avada Kedavra (Killing Curse) ===
Pronunciation: /əˈvɑːdə kəˈdɑːvrə/ ə-VAH-də kə-DAH-vrə
Description: Causes instant, painless death to whomever the curse hits. There is no countercurse or method of blocking this spell; however, if someone sacrifices their life for someone else, the person who was saved will not encounter any adverse effects of any curses by the specific attacker (e.g. when Lily Potter sacrificed her life for Harry Potter at Voldemort's hands, Harry became immune to curses cast by Voldemort). One of the three Unforgivable Curses.
Survivors: Only two people in the history of the magical world are known to have survived the killing curse – Harry Potter and Voldemort; the latter was only saved by his horcruxes. Harry was hit twice directly. Phoenixes can also survive a killing curse. They burst into flame as they would do in old age and are reborn from the ashes. This occurred in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
Seen/mentioned: First said (not by name) at the beginning of the first book when Harry arrives at the Dursleys' home. Seen first in Goblet of Fire against Muggle Frank Bryce, and in every book following.
Suggested etymology: During an audience interview at the Edinburgh Book Festival (15 April 2004) Rowling said: "Does anyone know where Avada Kedavra came from? It is an ancient spell in Aramaic, and it is the original of Abracadabra, which means 'let the thing be destroyed'. Originally, it was used to cure illness and the 'thing' was the illness, but I decided to make it the 'thing' as in the person standing in front of me. I take a lot of liberties with things like that. I twist them round and make them mine." Rowling's use of this name may have been influenced by Latin cadaver = "corpse".


=== Avis ===
Pronunciation: /ˈeɪvɨs/ AY-vis
Description: This charm creates a flock of birds from the caster's wand. When coupled with Oppugno, it can be used offensively.
Seen/mentioned: Shown in Goblet of Fire, cast by Mr Ollivander to test Viktor Krum's wand.[GF Ch.18] In Half-Blood Prince, it is cast by Hermione, followed by Oppugno which causes the birds to attack Ron.[HBP Ch.14]

Later, in Order of the Phoenix, the charm is used to hide the location of the headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix. Order members in Deathly Hallows also use it to protect their homes.
Notes: Rowling previously stated that when a Secret-Keeper dies, the Secret they held can never be revealed to anyone else; the people who were told before the Secret-Keeper's death will still know the secret, but after the death of the Secret-Keeper no one new can be brought into the circle of knowledge.

=== Finite Incantatem ===
Pronunciation: /fɪˈniːteɪ ˌɪŋkənˈtætəm/ fi-NEE-tay IN-kən-TAHT-əm
Description: Negates many spells or the effects of many spells.
Seen/mentioned: Snape uses it in Chamber of Secrets to restore order in the Duelling Club when Harry and Draco are duelling. Lupin uses the short form "Finite" in Order of the Phoenix.

=== (Unbreakable Vow) ===
Description: Causes a vow taken by a witch or wizard to be inviolable; if he or she should break it, the consequence is death. It manifests itself as interlinking chains of fire binding the clasped hands of the people taking the Vow; the fire shoots out as a tongue of flame from the wand of the Binder (a witness to the Vow) every time the person who takes the vow makes a promise. The flames then form into the linking chains. According to Ron Weasley, the spell causes death to anyone who breaks the vow.
