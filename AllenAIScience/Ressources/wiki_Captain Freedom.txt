Captain Freedom is a fictional comic book superhero from the period known as "Golden Age of Comic Books". His creator was identified as "Franklin Flagg" in the credits, but the identity of the individual behind the pseudonym remains unknown to this day. He first appeared in Speed Comics #13 (May 1941), a Harvey Comics title. He continued to appear in Speed Comics until its cancellation. He was revived by AC Comics, where he became an inspiration for Liberty Corps, a minor superhero team composed of members (each identified as Captain Freedom) from around the world.
