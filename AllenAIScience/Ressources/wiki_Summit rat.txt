The summit rat (Rattus baluensis) is a species of rodent in the family Muridae. It is found only in Malaysia.
The summit rat has a mutualistic relationship with a species of giant pitcher plant, Nepenthes rajah. Like the treeshrew Tupaia montana, it defecates into the plant's traps while visiting them to feed on sweet, fruity secretions from glands on the pitcher lids.
