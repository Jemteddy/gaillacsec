Pulmonary stretch receptors are mechanoreceptors found in the lungs.
When the lung expands, the receptors initiate the Hering-Breuer reflex, which reduces the respiratory rate. Increased firing from the stretch receptors also increases production of pulmonary surfactant. Intercostal muscles and diaphragm receive impulses from the respiratory centre, stretch receptors in the lungs send impulses to the respiratory centre giving information about the state of the lungs.
