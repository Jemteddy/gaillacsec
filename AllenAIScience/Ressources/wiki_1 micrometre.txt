To help compare different orders of magnitude this page lists some items with lengths between 10−6 and 10−5 m (between 1 and 10 micrometres, or µm).
Distances shorter than 1 µm
~0.7–300 µm — Wavelength of infrared radiation
1 µm — the side of square of area 10−12 m2
1 µm — edge of cube of volume 10−18 m3 (1 fL)
1–10 µm — diameter of a typical bacterium
1.55 µm — wavelength of light used in optical fibre
3–4 µm — size of a typical yeast cell
5 µm — length of a typical human spermatozoon's head 
6 µm — anthrax spore
7 µm — diameter of the nucleus of a typical eukaryotic cell
about 7 μm — diameter of human red blood cells 
3–8 µm — width of strand of spider web silk
8 µm — width of a chloroplast
9 µm — thickness of the tape in a 120-minute compact cassette.
about 10 µm — size of a fog, mist or cloud water droplet
Distances longer than 10 µm
