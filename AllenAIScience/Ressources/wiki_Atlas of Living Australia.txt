The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) is an online repository of information about Australian plants, animals, and fungi. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is an organisation significantly involved in the development of the ALA. The Atlas of Living Australia is the Australian node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The ALA is being use to help assess suitability of revegetation projects by determining species vulnerability to climatic and atmospheric change.
