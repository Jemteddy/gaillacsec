In molecular biology, activating transcription factor, ATF, is a group of bZIP transcription factors, which act as homodimers or heterodimers with a range of other bZIP factors. First, they have been described as members of the CREB/ATF family, whereas it turned out later that some of them might be more similar to AP-1-like factors such as c-Jun or c-Fos.
Genes include ATF1, ATF2, ATF3, ATF4, ATF5, ATF6, and ATF7.
