A tetrasomy is a form of aneuploidy with the presence of four copies, instead of the normal two, of a particular chromosome.


== Causes ==


=== Full ===
Full tetrasomy of an individual occurs due to non-disjunction when the cells are dividing (meiosis I or II) to form egg and sperm cells (gametogenesis). This can result in extra chromosomes in a sperm or egg cell. After fertilization, the resulting fetus has 48 chromosomes instead of the typical 46.


=== Autosomal tetrasomies ===
Cat eye syndrome where tetrasomy of chromosome 22 is present
Pallister-Killian syndrome (tetrasomy 12p)
Tetrasomy 9p
Tetrasomy 18p


=== Sex-chromosome tetrasomies ===
48, XXXX syndrome
48, XXYY syndrome
Klinefelter's syndrome, where XXXY tetrasomy is present
