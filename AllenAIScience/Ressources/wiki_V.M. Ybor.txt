V.M. Ybor is a neighborhood within the city limits of Tampa, Florida, United States. As of the 2000 census the neighborhood had a population of 3,010. The ZIP Codes serving the neighborhood are 33602, 33603, and 33605.
The area was part of the historic boundaries of Ybor City, but is not part of the Ybor City Historic District and is officially classified as a separate neighborhood. The "V.M." in the name stands for "Vicente Martinez", as in Vicente Martinez Ybor, the Spanish cigar manufacturer who founded Ybor City in 1885.


== History ==

The area now known as V.M. Ybor was cleared and settled soon after Ybor City was founded in 1885 and was annexed by the city of Tampa in 1887. For several decades, many Cuban, Spanish, and Italian cigar workers lived in what was once a middle-class neighborhood just a few blocks north of the commercial district of Ybor City that centered on 7th Avenue.
The area slowly deteriorated along with much of the rest of Ybor City after the Great Depression and World War II, when changes in the cigar industry eliminated the main source of employment, causing the children of the original residents to move away in large numbers. While many structures in Ybor City were razed by Urban Renewal and during the construction of Interstate 4 in the 1960s, much of what became V.M. Ybor was left untouched. The demographics of the area changed significantly during this period, however, as the outgoing middle-class "Latin" population was replaced by predominantly low-income African-American residents.
Today, many homes, commercial buildings, and cigar factories built in the early 1900s still stand. Most are still in use, often in various states of disrepair. Despite several attempts to rejuvenate the neighborhood, poverty is still very prevalent.
