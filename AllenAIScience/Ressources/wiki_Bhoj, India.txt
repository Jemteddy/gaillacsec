Bhoj is a village in Belgaum district in the southern state of Karnataka, India.
Bhoj is a big village surrounded by Vedaganga River in two sides viz. south and west. There is sangam pf two rivers Vedaganga and Doodhaganga at north west and making Doodhaganga river her way from west to east.
It is a good old story about Bhoj and her famous legendary Swamis goes like this. There was a Godman by name HH Mahant Swamiji. His era is not ascertainable. Maybe around 500 to 600 years back. His Samaadhi is there in Bhoj. His contemporary HH Bangal Saab Maharaj was also lived in nearby village called Karadaga. Karadaga is hardly 2 km away. There is holy river in between. Both these Godmen used to meet each other and exchange their views and respect for the Lords. During olden days especially in rainy season it is not possible to cross the Doodhaganga river flooded. Karadaga Bangaal Saab used to cross the river by sitting simply on a mat in full flooded river. Thus both the swamijis used to meet each other daily what may come.
