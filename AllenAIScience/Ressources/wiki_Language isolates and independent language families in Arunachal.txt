Language isolates and independent language families in Arunachal are lanuages in Arunachal Pradesh, India, traditionally classified in Sino-Tibetan languages but recently possibly being language isolates and independent language families. Blench (2011) proposed four language isolates (Hruso, Miji, Miju and Puroik) and three independent families (Mishmic, Kamengic and Siangic). The relation with Sino-Tibetan languages is possibly by regional effect.
