tuaThis is a master song list for Andamiro's Pump It Up video game series.
Pump It Up features the in-house musician BanYa (separated artists are Yahpp, Msgoon and BanYa Production), who were responsible for original songs in the series under dance pop, rock, heavy metal, jazz, folk, progressive and house genre, including the remixes of classical pieces such as Canon-D, Turkey March and Moonlight. In Pump It Up Fiesta, MAX, Doin and SHK (originally from O2Jam) joined as new in-house musicians.
Also, from Pump It Up 1st Dance Floor and onward are the large number of licensed K-pop songs from popular South Korean artists. Starting with Pump It Up Premiere and onward, the international songs are included mostly from North America, Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, China, etc. In almost every version, BanYa were also responsible for nonstop remixes that mixes numerous K-pop and world music songs, especially original songs (examples are J Knows that Old Bong, World Remix, Turkey Virus, K-pop Dance, Chicago Club Mix, etc.), but they are available in Remix Station (Special Zone in NX) and/or WorldMax in NX2 and NXA (Quest World in Fiesta). Starting Exceed 2, full songs are added only in separate stations.
The background animations, or BGAs, are contributed to almost every song in Pump It Up series to add multimedia along with the song played, but some are generic in-game BGAs for remixes and full songs (especially regular songs when the visualizers have insufficient time to release until the next update or arcade mix). Some of these BGA's differ from each other, meaning they are visualized by numerous artistso, but most of them are uncredited in unknown reasons. In Pump It Up Fiesta EX, it marks the first game since Pump It Up 3rd Dance Floor (BanYa's "An Interesting View") where the visualizers are credited. These artists or animators can have either worked with Andamiro in-house, or been commissioned from animation studios outside. Starting Pump It Up Zero, the live music video for the licensed K-pop song (and world music beginning in Pump It Up Fiesta 2, not in home version Exceed S.E.) is added (Footprints by T.O, e.g.) when Andamiro purchased a video from the record companies and studios. They are also cut for a regular song.
