Langstone is an electoral ward and smaller village and community of the city of Newport, Wales. The area is governed by the Newport City Council.


== Location ==
Langstone is situated on the eastern edge of the city and is one of Newport's more affluent areas, less than a mile from Junction 24 (Coldra) of the M4 motorway. Some of the ward is hilly and heavily forested. It is bounded to the north and east by the city boundary, to the west by the Caerleon ward and to the south west by the Ringland and Llanwern wards.


== Development ==
The original village was a small linear settlement along the A48 (Chepstow Road) and its offshoot, Tregarn Road. Since the 1990s, many have moved to the area because of its appeal as being rural, but also minutes away from the M4 motorway. This population influx in the '90s resulted in the construction of a large housing development at the bottom of Cat's Ash Road, together with developments of housing estates, big and small, along Tregarn Road and Magor Road.
The ward contains the parishes of Penhow and Llanvaches, as well as the parish of Langstone (population 2,770). The parish itself contains the hamlets of Llanbeder, Llandevaud and Llanmartin as well as Langstone itself.


== History ==
The actual village of Langstone (excluding the adjoining villages of Penhow-Parc Seymour, Llanvaches, Llandevaud, Llanbedr and Llanmartin) in 1801 had 126 inhabitants. By 1901 the population had risen to 206. The United Kingdom Census 2001 recorded the population as 3,905 people.
In 1891 Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire noted that Llanbedr was a hamlet, one and a half miles north-east of the parish, on the road from Newport to Chepstow. There were some remains of a church there, being then used as a barn.
