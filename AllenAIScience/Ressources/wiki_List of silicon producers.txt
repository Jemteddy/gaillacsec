A list of silicon producers involves several very different stages of production. Production starts at silicon metal, which is the material used to gain high purity silicon. High purity silicon - coming in different grades of purity - will be used for growing silicon ingots, which will be sliced to wafers in a process called wafering. Compositionally pure polycrystalline silicon wafers are useful for photovoltaics), dislocation-free and extremely flat single-crystal silicon wafers are required in the manufacture of computer chips).
