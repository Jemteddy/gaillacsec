This list of Ivy League business schools outlines the six universities of the Ivy League that host a business school. The creation of business schools at Ivy League universities occurred over a period of nearly a century, beginning with the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, founded in 1881 by Joseph Wharton, which was the first collegiate (undergraduate) business school in the world. In 1900, the Tuck School at Dartmouth was founded as the world's first graduate school of business; and in 1921, Harvard Business School became the first business school to offer the MBA degree.
Two Ivy League universities, Brown University and Princeton University, do not have business schools. Princeton is home to the Bendheim Center for Finance, which specializes in quantitative finance and offers an undergraduate finance certificate and the masters in finance degree. Brown offers a Business Economics track within its Commerce, Organizations and Entrepreneurship undergraduate concentration, and a joint MBA program with Spain's Instituto de Empresa Business School.
