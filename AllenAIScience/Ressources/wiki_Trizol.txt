TRIzol is a chemical solution used in RNA/DNA/protein extraction, by the reference paper from Piotr Chomczy≈Ñski and Sacchi, N. in 1987.
TRIzol is the brand name of the product from Ambion part of Life Technologies, and the brand name from MRC, which was founded by Chomczynski, is TRI Reagent.
The correct name of the method is Guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction. The use of TRIzol can result in DNA and RNA yields comparable to other extraction methods. An alternative method for RNA extraction is phenol extraction and TCA/acetone precipitation. Chloroform should be exchanged with 1-bromo-3-chloropropane when using the new generation TRI Reagent.
TRIzol is light sensitive and is often stored in a dark-colored, glass container covered in foil. It must be kept below room temperature.
When used, it resembles cough syrup, bright pink. The smell of the phenol is extremely strong. TRIzol works by maintaining RNA integrity during tissue homogenization, while at the same time disrupting and breaking down cells and cell components.


== Hazards ==
Caution should be taken while using TRIzol (specifically phenol) and Chloroform.
Exposure to TRIzol can be a serious health hazard. Exposure can lead to serious chemical burns and permanent scarring. A lab coat, gloves and a plastic apron are recommended
