== History ==


=== Early years ===
In 1954, K.R. Perry opened a Ben Franklin variety store in Norfolk, Virginia, which later became known as K&K 5&10. In 1970, K.R. Perry, Doug Perry, and Macon Brock started K&K Toys in Norfolk, Virginia. This mall concept grew to over 130 stores on the East Coast. In 1986, Doug Perry, Macon Brock, and Ray Compton started another chain store called Only $1.00 with five stores, one in Georgia, one in Tennessee, and three in Virginia. The expansion of Dollar Stores was continued alongside K&K Toys stores, mostly in enclosed malls. In 1991, the corporation made a decision to focus exclusively on the expansion of dollar stores after selling K&K stores to KB Toys, a Melville Corporation.


=== 1990s ===
In 1993, the name Only $1.00 was changed to Dollar Tree Stores to address what could be a multi-price-point strategy in the future, and part equity interest was sold to SKM partners, a private equity firm.
In March 6 of 1995, Dollar Tree, Inc. went public on the NASDAQ exchange in March at $15 a share, with a market cap then calculated at $225 million.
In 1996, Dollar Tree acquired Dollar Bill$, Inc., a Chicago-based chain of 136 stores.

In June 2015, the firm agreed to sell 330 stores to private equity company Sycamore Partners as part of the approval process for its $8.5 billion takeover of Family Dollar.


== Business Strategy ==
Dollar tree is able to offer extremely low prices for all of its products. It claims to be able to achieve this because their buyers "work extremely hard to find the best bargains out there", and it has "great control over the tremendous buying power at the dollar price-point". Its prices are primarily designed to attract those with financial difficulties, but it has also become popular with more affluent customers.


=== Family Dollar bidding ===

On July 28, 2014, Dollar Tree announced that a deal had been reached and approved by both parties to purchase Family Dollar for $8.5 billion plus acquisition of the $1 billion in debt currently held by Family Dollar. The deal came in the month following activist investor and major shareholder Carl Icahn's demand that Family Dollar be promptly put up for sale. After their reported deal had been struck, Dollar General entered the bidding, surpassing Dollar Tree's offer, with a $9.7 billion bid on August 18, 2014. On August 20, 2014 Family Dollar rejected the Dollar General bid, saying it was not a matter of price, but concerns over antitrust issues that had convinced the company and its advisers that the deal could not be concluded on the terms proposed. The Family Dollar board had been analyzing potential antitrust issues that could arise from doing a deal with Dollar General, since the start of the year a statement from CEO Howard Levine outlined.


== Canada ==

In November 2010, Dollar Tree announced that it had acquired 86 Canadian Dollar Giant Stores based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The stores are operated in British Columbia, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan. These are the first retail locations outside of the United States operated by Dollar Tree.


== Recalls ==

The recalled products include salsa jars with broken glass inside them, hot melt mini glue guns (recalled in January 2008) which could short circuit and cause burns and candle sets (recalled in February 2004) which could produce excessive flame.
