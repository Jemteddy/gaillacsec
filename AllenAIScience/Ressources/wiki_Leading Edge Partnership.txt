The Leading Edge Partnership programme was established in 2003 by the Department for Children, Schools and Families in the United Kingdom. The programme encourages Secondary schools in England to work in partnership to solve some of the most intractable problems in education. In 2005, the programme expanded significantly as a High Performing Specialist School designation option, managed by the Schools Network (formerly known as the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust).
The programme continues to encourage schools to work locally, regionally and nationally to raise achievement through the sharing of proven ideas. There are currently over 300 Leading Edge schools within the programme, representing some of the most outstanding and innovative practice nationally.
