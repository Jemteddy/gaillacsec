An acquired disorder is a medical condition which develops post-fetally; in contrast with a congenital disorder, which is present at birth. A congenital disorder may be antecedent to an acquired disorder (such as Eisenmenger's syndrome).
The term acquired may also be used to describe permanent or temporary modifications or devices (such as a shunt) which have been placed or created by a medical professional during palliation or treatment of a medical condition.
