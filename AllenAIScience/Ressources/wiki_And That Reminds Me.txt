"And That Reminds Me," also known as "My Heart Reminds Me," is a popular song.
The music was based on the Italian instrumental, "Autumn Concerto," by Camillo Bargoni. As "Autumn Concerto", it reached the Music Vendor pop survey in versions by Richard Hayman and Carmen Cavallaro.
English language lyrics were written by Al Stillman and Paul Siegel.
The first recorded version was done by Della Reese and The Honey Dreamers in 1957, under the title "And That Reminds Me" (Jubilee Records catalog number 5292), and it reached #9 on the weekly Billboard chart, and #12 for the year. It also peaked at number #16 on Cash Box' Best Seller chart. Kay Starr came out with another version under the title "My Heart Reminds Me" (RCA Victor Records catalog number 47-6981), which entered the chart a week after Reese's and reached #9 for the year. The song (in both versions, combined) peaked at #15 on the Cash Box chart that year.
The song was revived in 1969 by The Four Seasons, a version that reached #45 on the chart.
