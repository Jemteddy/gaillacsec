Michael Taylor (born 24 April 1934) is a former racing driver from Great Britain. He participated in 2 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 18 July 1959. He scored no championship points. He also participated in several non-Championship Formula One races. His racing career effectively ended when his steering column weld failed on his Lotus 18 in the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix at 160 mph (260 km/h). He was thrown from the car, cutting down a tree with his body and broke several bones (Alan Stacey and Chris Bristow were killed and Stirling Moss was also injured at the event, crashing his Lotus 18 in practice). He was paralysed, but due to therapy he is now on his feet.
Because of his car failure Taylor later sued Lotus successfully, one of the few successful actions against the makers of a racing car.
Taylor never raced again after his accident at Spa Francorchamps but turned instead to property speculation.
