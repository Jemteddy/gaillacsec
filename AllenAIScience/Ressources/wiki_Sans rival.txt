Sans rival is a Filipino dessert cake made of layers of buttercream, meringue and chopped cashews. Its name comes from the French phrase with the literal meaning without rival. The cake may be decorated, left plain or garnished with pistachios. This recipe has its roots from Dacquoise.
A similar, smaller version of this recipe is called a Silvana.
