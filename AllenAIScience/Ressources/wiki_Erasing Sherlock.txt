Erasing Sherlock is an original novel by Kelly Hale set in the Faction Paradox universe.
It is the last Faction Paradox novel to be published by Mad Norwegian Press, though not the last in the series. Although taking place in a shared universe, it is a stand-alone work that does not require any prior knowledge of Faction Paradox.
The novel is based on a previous work, Erasing Sherlock Holmes, which won a $10,000 award in the Great North American Fiction Contest and was published as an e-book by PublishingOnline.com. It has been described as a "fascinating (and undeservedly obscure) novel"  and reviewed in publications ranging from various Sherlock Holmes Society publications to the science fiction, Aeon Magazine.
