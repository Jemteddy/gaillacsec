Argon 18 is a Canadian cycle manufacturer founded in 1989 by retired cyclist Gervais Rioux in Montreal, Quebec. The name is derived from the element Argon, which is number 18 on the periodic table of elements.

Established in Montreal, Canada since 1989, Argon 18 was originally formed of an R&D team guided by Gervais Rioux and North American racers, who designed the Argon 18 bikes. Rioux represented Canada in major international events, such as the Commonwealth Games in 1982 and the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. In 1989 M. Rioux bought a small shop in central Montreal.
