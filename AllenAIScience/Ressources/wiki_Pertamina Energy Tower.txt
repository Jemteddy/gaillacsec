Pertamina Energy Tower is a 99-story, 530-metre (1,740 ft) skyscraper under construction in Jakarta, Indonesia, which will be the tallest building in Indonesia upon completion. It was designed and planned by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP (SOM), a private Architecture and Design company, and will be the new HQ of the state-owned company Pertamina Energy. Construction work on the tower began in January 2014 and it is expected to be completed in 2020.
It will be a Zero-energy building designed to generate as much energy as it uses. Its feature is to be Eco-friendly, as it uses highly sustainable energy produced by itself, as it shows a mix of different types of renewable energy, deep well geothermal, pv, and a wind funnel, located on the top of the tower. This takes advantage of the prevailing winds that blow faster at the height of 530 meters. Increased energy production means the Tower's energy consumption rate can be high and the energy consumed will still be clean.
