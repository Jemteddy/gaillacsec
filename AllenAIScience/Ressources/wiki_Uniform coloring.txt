In geometry, a uniform coloring is a property of a uniform figure (uniform tiling or uniform polyhedron) that is colored to be vertex-transitive. Different symmetries can be expressed on the same geometric figure with the faces following different uniform color patterns.
A uniform coloring can be specified by listing the different colors with indices around a vertex figure.


== n-uniform figures ==
In addition, an n-uniform coloring is a property of a uniform figure which has n types vertex figure, that are collectively vertex transitive.


== Archimedean coloring ==
A related term is Archimedean color which doesn't require transitivity but just requires one vertex figure coloring repeated in a periodic arrangement. And a more general term are k-Archimedean colorings which count k distinctly colored vertex figures.
For example this Archimedean coloring (left) of a triangular tiling has two colors, but requires 4 unique colors by symmetry positions and become a 2-uniform coloring (right):
