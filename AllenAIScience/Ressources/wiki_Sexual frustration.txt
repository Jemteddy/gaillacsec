Sexual frustration is frustration caused by a discrepancy between one's desired and achieved sexual activity. It can be a result of obtaining less sexual activity than desired, or of not being satisfied during sexual activity (which may be due to issues such as anorgasmia, premature ejaculation, or erectile dysfunction).
