Like It or Not is a compilation album by American alternative rock band Caroline's Spine. Having parting ways with Hollywood Records, the band returned to their independent origins with this album. Some of the tracks are live recordings and one, "Moby Stick," is a drum solo by Jason Gilardi. Most tracks are available on previous albums, and this recording was largely intended to provide fans who may not have had a chance to acquire older albums to purchase a compilation album.
