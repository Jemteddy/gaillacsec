Aloma's Ruler (1979–2003) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who won the second leg of the 1982 U.S. Triple Crown series, the Preakness Stakes.


== Background ==
Aloma's Ruler was purchased for $92,000 at the 1981 Hialeah, Florida sale of two-year-olds by Baltimore, Maryland businessman Nathan "Red" Scherr (1923–2003), who was advised by trainer John Lenzini, Jr..


== Racing career ==
Sent to the track at age two, Aloma's Ruler won one stakes race. At age three in 1982, he won the Bahamas Stakes at Hialeah Park Race Track on January 7 and the May 8 Withers Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack. Then, in the biggest win of his career, he defeated prohibitive favorite Linkage in the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course. In a race devoid of early speed, Aloma's Ruler made the lead easily, slowed the pace down the back stretch, and held on to win. He finished ninth in the Belmont Stakes and won the Jersey Derby at Monmouth Park in July. Aloma's Ruler came out of a second-place finish in the August 21st Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course with an ankle injury that ended his racing career.
Retired to stud, Aloma's Ruler met with limited success. From his eighteen crops, he sired six stakes winners.
Aloma's Ruler died from an apparent heart attack at age twenty-four on June 21, 2003, at an Illinois farm.
