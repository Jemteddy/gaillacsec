KenGen relies on various sources to generate electricity ranging from hydro, geothermal, thermal and wind. Hydro is the leading source, with an installed capacity of 0.821 GW, which is 52.3 percent of the company’s installed capacity.
The company owns 14 hydropower plants with a combined capacity of 820 MW, five thermal power plants of 256 MW, five geothermal power plants of 493 MW and one Wind power plant of 5.1 MW resulting a total installed capacity of 1,5695 GW.

The power stations are within the great Rift Valley adjacent to the famous Hell’s Gate National Park, and also bordering Lake Naivasha.


== History ==
The company was founded on February 1, 1954 as Kenya Power Company (KPC) and was commissioned to construct the transmission line between Nairobi and Tororo in Uganda This was to transmit power generated at the Owen Falls Dam to Kenya. KPC was as well tasked to develop electricity generating facilities in the country.
KPC was managed by the Kenya Power and Lighting Company under a management contract. In January 1997, the management of KPC was formally separated from Kenya Power as a direct result of reforms being under taken in the energy sector and the entire economy. Subsequently, on January 19, 1998 the company changed its name from Kenya Power Company to Kenya Electricity Generating Company. The trading name KenGen was also adopted at this point.
In 2006, KenGen was listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange after the Government of Kenya sold 30% of its stake in the Company through a successful Initial Public Offer that received over 280,000 applications.
