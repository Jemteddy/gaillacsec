Keratosis (from keratinocyte, the prominent cell type in the epidermis, and -osis, abnormal) is a growth of keratin on the skin or on mucous membranes. More specifically, it can refer to:
actinic keratosis (also known as solar keratosis)
hydrocarbon keratosis
keratosis pilaris (KP, also known as follicular keratosis)
seborrheic keratosis
Actinic keratoses are pre-malignant growths. Seborrheic keratoses are not pre-malignant.
