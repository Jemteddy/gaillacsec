Vice President Anti Slavery Society [1] 1968 (Secretary 1941-56, Director 1957-68 [2]). Born on 10 January 1889, in the parish of St James, Barbados, youngest son of Charles Joseph Greenidge, member of the Colonial Parliament of Barbados, West Indies, by his second wife, Edith Marion Wood. He was a distant cousin of Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge.
He was educated at Harrison College, Barbados, and then Downing College, Cambridge, where he read law. He was appointed Magistrate in St Kitts, Leeward Islands, in 1919 and magistrate in Barbados in 1923, rising to Court of Appeal Judge in 1925. He transferred to Port of Spain, Trinidad in 1927 where he was a magistrate and acted as its Solicitor General and then Attorney General as well as being a member of the Legislative Council. A further posting as Chief Justice of British Honduras followed in 1932-36. In 1936, he took up the post of Solicitor General of Nigeria where he remained for five years. He was a Member of Commission on Development of British Guyana and British Honduras in 1947 and appointed to the United Nations' Ad Hoc Committee of Experts on Slavery 1950-51. Between 1958 and 1962, he was a Member of the Legislative Council of Barbados. When he was not posted overseas he lived most of his life in Barbados, with a second home in Malta. He was unmarried and died 28 April 1972 in Nice, France.
The Greenidge family trace their ancestry in Barbados to John of Greenwich who left London on 2 May 1635 on the ship Alexander. Within one generation the etymon, meaning Green Port or Trading Place (cf Norwich, Harwich Ipswich and Sandwich in England) of the surname had assumed the distinctly West Indian orthographic format of Greenidge, whilst maintaining a very similar phenomic identity.
