The 1995–96 season of the Philippine Basketball League (PBL).


== Notable achievements ==
Under coach Junel Baculi, the PBL-Andoks team won the Asian Interclub basketball championships in Kuala Lumpur, defeating Malaysia-Petronas, 101–82, in the finals. The PBL selection were reinforced by seven-time PBA best import Bobby Parks and former Ginebra import Alexander Coles.
The Stag Pale Pilseners completed a three-conference sweep and a grandslam in their very first season in the PBL. The Pilseners of coach Alfrancis Chua, with the likes of MVP Marlou Aquino, Bal David, Reuben Dela Rosa, Randy Alcantara, Derrick Bughao, Paul Du and best import Antoine Joubert, became the third team to win a title in their first try during the Reinforced Conference, defeating Red Bull Energy Drink in four games.  Stag had an easier time scoring a three-game finals sweep in the next two conferences, winning over Casino Rubbing Alcohol in the All-Filipino Cup and repeating over Red Bull in the Danny Floro Cup on January 1996.

The PBL took a two-week break during the month of June to give way to the ABC Championships where most of the top players are members of the national team, the league resume on June 29 with the best-of-three semifinal pairings in the short All-Filipino Cup.
