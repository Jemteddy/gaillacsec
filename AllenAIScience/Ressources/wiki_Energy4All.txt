Energy4All facilitates the creation and development of wind turbine cooperatives in the United Kingdom, based on the experienced gained in the creation of the UK's first wind co-op, Baywind Energy Co-operative. It has gone on to raise at least Â£6million on behalf of the co-operatives, through community share offerings.
Whilst not technically a co-operative itself, the organisation has helped create at least ten wind co-ops, including Westmill Wind Farm Co-operative and Boyndie Wind Farm Co-operative, who, along with Baywind, own Energy4All.
One of the co-operatives it has created, Energy Prospects Co-operative, specialises in taking early stage wind co-operatives through the development and planning application stages to the point where a community share offer, managed by Energy4All, can be launched to fund the project.
They won an Ashden Award in 2012.
