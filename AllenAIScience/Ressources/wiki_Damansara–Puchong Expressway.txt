The Damansara–Puchong Expressway or Lebuhraya Damansara-Puchong, LDP,  is a major expressway in Klang Valley, Selangor in Malaysia. It links major townships in Damansara and Puchong and decreases travel time between them. Besides that, the 40 km (25 mi) expressway provides better accessibility to these areas via links to other expressways in Klang Valley, such as Federal Highway , Puchong-Sungai Besi Highway , New Pantai Expressway (NPE) , Sprint Expressway , Sungai Buloh Highway , and Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2 (MRR2) . This expressway is part of the Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2 Scheme.


== Route background ==
The Kilometre Zero of the Damansara–Puchong Expressway is located at Sri Damansara Interchange, where it connects with the Federal Route  and Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2, Federal Route .


== History ==
The construction of the Damansara–Puchong Expressway was awarded to Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Bhd (Litrak). On 23 April 1996, the Concession Agreement was signed between the Government of Malaysia and Litrak for the privatisation of the improvement, upgrading, design, construction, maintenance, operations and management of Damansara–Puchong Expressway.
Construction of the expressway began on September 1996 and completed on December 1998. The work was awarded on a turnkey basis (i.e. design and construct) to Gamuda–Irama Duta Joint Venture (GIDJV) at a cost of RM 1.1 billion. The overall cost for expressway is RM 1.4 billon. The expressway was opened to traffic on 25 January 1999.
With the completion of the Damansara–Puchong Expressway, the Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2 (MRR2) is substantially completed on the west of Kuala Lumpur which provides for free flow and ease congestion. It also links Bandar Sunway to Puchong, which has been long awaited, and traveling time is shortened between Petaling Jaya and Puchong. The expressways connects the Putrajaya and Hicom/Shah Alam with MRR2.
The expressway formerly featured its own electronic toll collection system known as the FasTrak. From 1 July 2004, the FasTrak was replaced by the Touch 'n Go and SmartTAG systems.

=== Upgrading of the TTDI Interchange ===
The TTDI Interchange upgrading project currently being undertaken by Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Bhd (Litrak) is an effort to improve the level of service on LDP.
The project which commenced in August 2007 with a total budget of RM133 million involves widening of certain stretches and building a flyover and an underpass at TTDI Interchange.
The congestion at the interchange is mainly due to multiple weaving of traffic from TTDI to Bandar Utama, TTDI to Damansara Utama and Damansara Utama to TTDI.. Once completed, the upgraded interchange will ease traffic flow from TTDI to Bandar Utama/Kepong and there will also be smoother flow on the LDP mainline to Bandar Utama and Kepong.
The upgraded interchange will also allow more green time for localized traffic movement.
The project work involves the following:
Upgrading of existing TTDI Interchange into a fully grade-separated Interchange through the construction of a new 2-lane bridge flyover for northbound traffic towards Kepong
Localised widening of northbound and southbound slip roads
An underpass from TTDI to Bandar Utama and Kepong.
The project is scheduled for full completion in May 2011 with the flyover expected to be opened earlier upon its completion.
