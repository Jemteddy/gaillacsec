A mineraloid is a mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. For example, obsidian is an amorphous glass and not a crystal. Jet is derived from decaying wood under extreme pressure. Opal is another mineraloid because of its non-crystalline nature. Pearl, considered by some to be a mineral because of the presence of calcium carbonate crystals within its structure, would be better considered a mineraloid because the crystals are bonded by an organic material, and there is no definite proportion of the components.


== Common mineraloidsEdit ==
Amber, non-crystalline structure, organic
Ebonite, vulcanized natural or synthetic rubber (organic); lacks a crystalline structure
Jet, non-crystalline nature, organic (very compact coal)
Lechatelierite, nearly pure silica glass
Limonite, a mixture of oxides and hydroxides of iron
Mercury, liquid (IMA/CNMNC valid mineral name)
Obsidian, volcanic glass - non-crystalline structure, a glass and quartz mixture
Opal, non-crystalline silicon dioxide, a mix of minerals (IMA/CNMNC valid mineral name)
Pearl, organically produced carbonate
Petroleum, liquid, organic
Pyrobitumen, amorphous fossilized petroleum (noncrystalline, organic)
Tektites, meteoritic silica glass
