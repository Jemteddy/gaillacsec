Academic dress of the University of Manchester describes the gowns, hoods and headwear which are prescribed by the university for its graduates and officers.


== Introduction ==
The University of Manchester was created as a result of the merger of UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester in 2004. Rather than adapt the academic dress of its predecessor institutions, the university appointed Ede & Ravenscroft to create a new range of academic robes upon its foundation.

In the university regulations it states: "Those Members of the University who are entitled to wear academic dress shall do so at the ceremonials of the University." The wearing of academic dress is largely confined to ceremonial occasions, essentially graduation congregations, therefore undergraduate gowns for university-wide purposes do not exist. However, in one traditional hall of residence, St. Anselm Hall, undergraduates wear academic gowns at formal dinner each night. Also, university staff participating in ceremonies as ushers wear a black gown of a different pattern than that prescribed for bachelor or master graduates.
At a University of Manchester graduation ceremony the graduands wear the academic dress appropriate to the qualification they are about to be awarded. Mortarboards or Tudor bonnets are worn at the finish of the ceremony and in procession, but held in the hand otherwise. Officers of the university and participating academics wear their headgear throughout, except when doffing their hats to the presiding officer and speakers.

Most hoods are of the Cambridge Full [f1] shape in the Groves classification system with the exception of the Certificates and Diplomas hood, which is of a modified Aberdeen [a7] shape. All have purple neckbands with a centrally-placed band of gold ribbon. Excepting those of doctors, all hoods are of black corded material.

== Officers ==

Officers of the university wear special academic dress on ceremonial occasions.
The robe of the Chancellor is of purple silk damask with flap collar and closed, square ended sleeves [d4], edged with silver lace throughout and trimmed with silver frogs on the sleeves, and with the university arms, crest and motto embroidered on each of the revers at chest height. The cap is a black velvet Tudor bonnet with a cord and tassels of silver. The robes worn by other university officers, such as the Vice-Chancellor, Deans and Registrars, and those deputising for them, are similar.
The mace-bearer wears a gown with square ended sleeves of plain purple silk or stuff, edged for one inch in gold ribbon, and a black Tudor bonnet with cord and tassels of gold. Major benefactors of the university and other people associated with the university (but who are neither students nor staff) can wear a similar gown at ceremonies.
