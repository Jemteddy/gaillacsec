Aestivation or estivation refers to the positional arrangement of the parts of a flower within a flower bud before it has opened. Aestivation is also sometimes referred to as praefoliation or prefoliation, but these terms may also mean vernation: the arrangement of leaves within a vegetative bud.
Aestivation can be an important taxonomic diagnostic; for example Malvaceae flower buds have valvate sepals, with the exception of the genera Fremontodendron and Chiranthodendron, which have sometimes been misplaced as a result.
The terms used to describe aestivation are the same as those used to describe leaf vernation. Classes of aestivation include:
imbricate – overlapping
contorted or twisted – every petal or sepal is outside its neighbour on one margin, and inside its neighbour on the other margin
cochleate – spirally twisted
contortiplicate – contorted and also plicate

quincuncial – with five parts, where two petals or sepals are outside all others, two are inside all others, and the fifth is outside on one margin and inside on the other

crumpled
decussate
induplicate – folded inwards
open – petals or sepals do not overlap or even touch each other
reduplicate – folded outwards
valvate – margins of adjacent petals or sepals touch each other without overlapping.
