The Shops at Sunset Place is an outdoor shopping mall in South Miami, Florida at the intersection of South Dixie Highway (US 1) and Red Road (West 57th Avenue). The mall opened in 1999 and is owned and managed by the Simon Property Group.
The Shops at Sunset Place is serviced by the Miami Metrorail at the South Miami station. The station is located across the street from the shopping mall on the corner of Sunset Drive and US 1.
The Shops at Sunset Place currently houses the Miami-area's only GameTime location. There is a Forever 21 across from a spot for a restaurant that recently opened with Brother Jimmy's BBQ. A Splitsville Luxury Lanes and Dinner Lounge bowling alley was added in 2008. The largest tenant is a 24-screen cinema operated by AMC Entertainment with about 92,000 square feet (8,547 m2).
Prior to the building of Sunset Place, the property was the site of The Bakery Centre, which opened in 1986 on the site of the old Holsum Bread Bakery. The Bakery Centre was a retail and office complex that included a 7-screen AMC Theatres multiplex. It was demolished in 1996.
