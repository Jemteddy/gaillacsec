Myogenic factor 6 (herculin) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MYF6 gene.  Also known in the medical literature as MRF4 and herculin), MYF6 is a myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) in the process known as myogenesis.


== Function ==
MYF6 is a member of the myogenic factors (MYF) family that regulate myogenesis and muscle regeneration. Myogenic factor are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. Defects in this gene are a cause of autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (ADCNM).


== Clinical significance ==
Mutations in the MYF6 gene are associated with myopathy.
