Featherfin Wildlife Management Area is a protected area located in Prince Edward, Appomattox, and Buckingham Counties, Virginia. It covers nearly 2,800 acres (11 km2) of forests and marsh along the Appomattox River; many stands of hardwood and pine (primarily loblolly) may be found within its boundaries. Some of these are found on old farm fields. There are also some wetland habitats located along the river.
