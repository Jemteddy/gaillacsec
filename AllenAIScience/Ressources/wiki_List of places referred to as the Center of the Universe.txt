Several places on Earth have been given the nickname "Center (or Centre) of the Universe." In addition, several fictional works have described a depicted location as being at the center of the universe.
Modern models of the Universe suggest it does not have a center, unlike previous systems which placed the Earth (Geocentrism) or the Sun (Heliocentrism) at the center of the universe.
