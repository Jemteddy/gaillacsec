Southern Peninsula (Icelandic: Suðurnes) is a region in southwest Iceland. The region has a population of more than 22,000 and is one of the more densely populated parts of the island. The administrative centre is Keflavík, which had 7,000 residents when it merged with the nearby town of Njarðvík several years ago to create Reykjanesbær, which is the second largest settlement outside the Greater Reykjavík area; on 1 January 2013 the town had a population of 14,231.
The region is the location of Keflavík International Airport, the major point of entry for Iceland, and also the Blue Lagoon health spa.
