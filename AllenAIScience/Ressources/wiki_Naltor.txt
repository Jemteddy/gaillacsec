Naltor is a fictional planet first depicted in stories of DC Comics' Legion of Super-Heroes set in the 30th and 31st Centuries. It was portrayed as being the home of Legion members Dream Boy, Dream Girl and her sister White Witch.
Natives of the planet are noted for their ability of precognition, providing them with glimpses of the future. Some Naltorians are without this ability, known as being "future blind" on Naltor. Mysa Nal is one of these Naltorians, which is what led her to study magic instead. Due to their precognitive abilities, it was implied that Naltor was a highly affluent planet, running an effective stock market and known for its investment banking sector amongst the other United Planets.
The planet is ruled by a High Seer, who has extensive abilities in this regard. Named High Seers pre-Zero Hour were Kiwa Nal (the mother of Dream Girl and White Witch) and Beren. During the Five Year Gap period of Legion history, Nura Nal left the Legion to succeed Beren as High Seer.
Naltor is home to the Naltor Dreamers, a popular Moopsball team. It is also known for being a matriarchal planet. In the Silver Age, it was said that Naltorian family members all had surnames different from each other. White Witch was, for example, said to be called Xola Aq, not sharing her sister Nura's surname. This was retconned when White Witch was reintroduced by Paul Levitz and Keith Giffen in the 1980s.
In the Waid/Kitson "reminagined" continuity, there is another Naltorian Legionnaire, Dream Boy.
