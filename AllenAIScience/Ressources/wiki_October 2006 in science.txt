=== October 9, 2006 ===
Combining astrometry data taken over many years at multiple observatories and the Hubble Space Telescope, a study obtains the exact mass and orbital inclination of the planet candidate of Epsilon Eridani. The inclination matches the already known value for the dust disk around the star. This strongly supports the notion of how planets form from the material around young stars. (SpaceRef.com)
