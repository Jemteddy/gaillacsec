The double-lip embouchure is a type of embouchure used in playing woodwind instruments like oboe and bassoon, and occasionally clarinet and saxophone. It contrasts with the single-lip embouchure in that both lips cover the dental surfaces. A double-lip embouchure is sometimes recommended by dentists for single-reed players for whom the single-lip approach is potentially harmful.
