== Key Contributions ==
Michael Kaufman’s work as co-founder and long-time volunteer with the White Ribbon Campaign in 1991, was based on the belief that a) the campaign should be decentralized, conceived of and led by the men and women within each community, b) that it should be politically non-partisan, reaching out to men across the political, religious, and social spectrum, and c) that it focus on a positive engagement of men and boys as individuals capable of bringing about change.
As a volunteer, he has been a leader in various national and international networks of profeminist men, including, most recently, MenCare, a global campaign focused on fatherhood which has the aim of men doing fifty percent of the care work on the planet.


== Key Ideas ==
Michael Kaufman’s widely published 1987 article, “The Construction of Masculinity and the Triad of Men’s Violence” postulated that our dominant forms of masculinity were constructed through ongoing, socially-sanctioned, and mutually reinforcing forms of violence: against women, against other men, and internalized against oneself.
“Men, Feminism, and Men’s Contradictory Experiences of Power” (1994 and revised in 1999) built on the argument of his book, Cracking the Armour: Power, Pain and the Lives of Men to look at the contradictory nature of men’s power.
His article, “The 7 P’s of Men’s Violence” (1999) has been translated into more than a dozen languages. It draws on key points of a feminist analysis of men’s violence.
“The AIM Framework: Addressing and Involving Men and Boys to Promote Gender Equality and End Gender Discrimination and Violence” (2001) synthesizes lessons from two decades of work by many individuals and organizations with men and boys and suggests that efforts to engage men must not only address men and boys about the importance of gender equality.
