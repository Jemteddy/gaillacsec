Florida Caverns State Park is a Florida's State Park, located in the Florida Panhandle near Marianna. It is home to the only air-filled caves accessible to tourists in Florida.
Florida Caverns is unusual for the state. The limestone caverns were formed over time, as water seeped into and dissolved local bedrock, forming stalagmites, stalactites and flowstones. The same phenomenon is occurring in many other locations throughout Florida; as years pass, local fissures may turn to holes, and holes into caves. However, the vast majority of Florida's groundwater erosion formations have stopped at the sinkhole stage and have not developed further into caves.
Florida Caverns State Park and the neighboring golf course were originally constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps as part of the New Deal.
