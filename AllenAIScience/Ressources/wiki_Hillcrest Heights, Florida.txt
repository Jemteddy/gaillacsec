== History ==
In 1917, the Lakeside Club was built on the south shore of Crooked Lake. A year later, this club burnt to the ground and was rebuilt and named the Hillcrest Lodge. This lodge was well known and many celebrities stayed there including Bobby Jones, Babe Ruth and William Jennings Bryan.
In 1923, the Village of Hillcrest Heights was incorporated. A year later, the town's dirt roads were all paved.

In the most recent 2009 elections, only the incumbent commissioners qualified and were elected by default.


=== Annexations ===
Although the town is only 107 acres (0.43 km2), the residents and government of Hillcrest Heights have been aggressive in keeping the status quo in the town. Because of encroaching annexations by the City of Frostproof, the town is exploring the possibility of annexing Crooked Lake and nearby shores which would increase the size of the town to 6.7 miles (10.8 km). Although the annexation would not increase the population of Hillcrest Heights, it would help stop development of nearby areas. Many residents of adjacent census-designated place(CDP) of Babson Park, with a population of over 1,000 are also fearful of the Frostproof annexations, and the Babson Park Visioning Group is considering either incorporating the CDP or asking for annexation by Hillcrest Heights.
