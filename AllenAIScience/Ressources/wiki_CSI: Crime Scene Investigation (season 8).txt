The eighth season of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation premiered on CBS on September 27, 2007 and ended May 15, 2008. Headlined by William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger, this is the final season to feature every member of the original main cast in a starring role. Due to the short episode order, this is the joint-third shortest season of the CSI franchise: tying with CSI: NY‍‍ '​‍s seventeen-episode final season, and surpassed by CSI: Cyber‍‍ '​‍s thirteen-episode first season, and CSI‍‍ '​‍s two-episode sixteenth and final season.


== Production ==
Only 11 episodes had been completed and aired before the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike. Only six more episodes were made after the strike, for a total of only 17 episodes. Jorja Fox signed on for only the first seven episodes of the eighth season. Some international broadcasters only showed the first part of the crossover "Who and What" because Without a Trace did not air (or aired older seasons) at the time.
