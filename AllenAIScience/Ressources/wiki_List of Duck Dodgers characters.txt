This is a list of characters from the American animated television series Duck Dodgers.


== Galactic Protectorate ==


=== Duck Dodgers ===

Captain Duck Edgar Dumas Aloysius Dodgers, the star of the show, was played by the fictional character Daffy Duck voiced by Joe Alaskey.
Duck Dodgers was accidentally frozen for over three centuries. He was revived by Dr. I.Q. Hi in the middle of the 24th century. Through scheming and lies, he managed to trick everyone into believing he was a 21st-century hero. In reality, he was only a water boy for a football team. He is arrogant, selfish, greedy, lazy, cowardly, gullible, and not particularly intelligent. He occasionally displays surprisingly high levels of heroism and competence, suggesting that he is not quite as daft as he appears to be, although he mostly succeeds through dumb luck and the work of the Eager Young Space Cadet. Ironically, Commander X-2 actually caused Dodgers to become a minor football star in the final game of the season, which is what he used to parlay himself into captaincy in the Protectorate, meaning that he is, technically, not lying when he claims he won a championship football game in his own time.


=== Cadet ===
The Eager Young Space Cadet, the faithful sidekick of Duck Dodgers, was played by the fictional character Porky Pig. He was voiced by Bob Bergen.
Cadet looks up to Dodgers, seeing him as a father-figure in many ways. He is utterly loyal to Dodgers and doesn't doubt a word he says. Despite being much smarter than his so-called hero, Cadet lets Dodgers give all the orders. Dodgers cares deeply for Cadet, though he rarely shows it. Dodgers relies heavily on the Cadet's assistance and would likely fail most missions without it; he often tries to take credit for the Cadet's work.
Cadet is also fairly successful as a ladies man, often being the one who gets the girl Dodgers swoons over. He graduated summa cum laude from the Protectorate Academy. Very little else is known about his past, though one episode portrays him as being the Prince and Ruler of his home planet of Swinus 9. Another episode reveals that Cadet's sister was sold to the sausage factory (by Dodgers), and villains trying to dethrone or otherwise eliminate him. However, Cadet reveals this background by telling a story to his overly rambunctious niece and nephews who expressed no prior knowledge of this. It is unknown whether or not this is true or just his attempt to impress his relatives. He claimed to Count Muerte that he ended world hunger, though this could be seen as bragging to a stranger.


=== I.Q. Hi ===
Dr. Ignatius Q. "I.Q." Hi is the scientist that revives Dodgers after being frozen for three centuries. He is the Chief Scientist for the Galactic Protectorate and usually acts as a representative on Earth on behalf of the World President. Hi is responsible for giving missions to the team. Serious and hard-working, he is often irritated and frustrated with Dodgers's incompetent side, and doubts that Dodgers truly was a 21st-century hero. Once a year, he serves as a cadet for one flight on Dodger's ship in order to evaluate Dodger's command. In college, he majored in Pointless Minutiae, which his mother warned him against. He also has a slight potassium deficiency.
I.Q. Hi first appeared in Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century, as the Secretary of the Stratosphere who briefs Duck Dodgers. He also appeared in the sequel, Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24½th Century. In both cartoons, he was voiced by Mel Blanc. His overall design was changed in the TV series. In the shorts, he was originally fat and wore a blue laboratory coat. In the new series Hi wears a traditional white lab coat and is rarely seen without gloves that extend to his elbow and leave a gap between his fingertips and the glove's tips. He also has a higher-pitched, more throaty voice which was provided by Richard McGonagle. Hi is bald beneath his lightbulb-hat.
Later episodes also show that I.Q. Hi owns an old castle inherited from his ancestors (which is later destroyed by Dodgers), enjoys lattes, fishing, and despite their rivalries, appears to be on friendly terms with Queen Tyr'ahnee. He also has a brother named Psy Q. Hi, who is a psychiatrist.
Dr. I.Q. Hi may be loosely based on the character of Dr. Huer in the Buck Rogers comic strip that Dodgers parodies. Hi's physical appearance mimics that of Larry Fine.
In addition to the Duck Dodgers series, I.Q. Hi also made a guest cameo on Tiny Toon Adventures in the segment "Duck Dodgers, Jr.", featured in the episode "The Return to the Acme Acres Zone". Here, he briefs Dodgers and Plucky Duck (appearing as Dodgers' sidekick) on the matter transmogrifier that Marvin is using to suck up the universe; he is then sucked up himself by the transmogrifier. In this cameo, I.Q. Hi's appearance, voiced by Jeff Bergman, was closer to that of the original cartoons.
Dr. I.Q. Hi also appeared in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System title Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions in which he appeared briefly in some in-between stage newspaper headline photos and (possibly) briefs Dodgers on his mission before each stage. He later appears as a boss, brainwashed by Marvin the Martian and strapped into a large war machine on the third planet's final area. The newspaper headline after the battle depicts I.Q. Hi (still under the effects of being brainwashed) being recruited as Dodgers' new cadet.


=== Captain Star Johnson ===
Captain Star Johnson is a member of the Space Protectorate who serves as a rival to Duck Dodgers. He was voiced by John O'Hurley
Johnson is a rival captain of Dodger's in the Galactic Protectorate. Johnson has a University education and played collegiate rocketball. His personality is like that of Flash Gordon. Johnson once took Dodgers to court over Dodger's incompetence. Since then, Johnson has been involved in freeing Mars from the military coup by General Z9 and searching for gangsters when Dodgers went missing for a brief period of time.


=== Captain Long ===
Captain Long is a member of the Galactic Protectorate. He appeared in "The Fudd" where he was one of the victims of the Mother Fudd. He was voiced by Michael Dorn.


=== Captain Dallas Rodman ===
Captain Dallas Rodman is a member of the Galactic Protectorate. Rodman appeared in only one episode, "The Best of Captains, The Worst of Captains" where he was nominated for Captain of the Year at the Galactic Protectorate's Captainee Awards. He closely resembled Buzz Lightyear. Rodman was voiced by Frank Welker


=== Captain Aurora Soleil ===
Captain Aurora Soleil served as a lieutenant in the Galactic Protectorate. At the Captainee Awards, Duck Dodgers and Star Johnson competed for her attention. At the awards, she was promoted to Captain for her heroic actions. Cadet voted for her in the "Captain of the Year" category. Soleil is based on Wilma Deering and voiced by Tisha Terrasini Banker.


=== Master Sergeant Emily Dickinson Jones ===
Master Sergeant Emily Dickinson Jones works at the Galactic Protectorate Training Academy on Earth. He is responsible for monitoring Duck Dodgers during his annual Protectorate Training Test, which Dodgers routinely avoids taking. He takes great pride in molding lazy Captains (like Dodgers) into decent shape to fight for the Protectorate, enjoying their suffering during training. However, he respects individuals who can think out of the box which is why Sgt. Jones let Dodgers pass the test despite the fact Dodgers managed to fail every one of the tests. Jones was voiced by Randy Savage.


=== Bigfoot ===
In "The Six Wazillion Dollar Duck" (a parody of The Six Million Dollar Man), it was revealed that Bigfoot worked for the Protectorate as a Maintenance Supervisor and was also the first being to receive cyborganic implants. Due to enhanced combat abilities, as he was able hold off several centurions before they baited and trapped him with pie. He seems not to be very educated, as the only two words he says are "Duck" and "Stereo". When Dodgers thwarted the Martians, Dr. Maniac escaped with Bigfoot and were seen in the fast food business. On the "Bonafide Heroes" show, Dr. Maniac and Bigfoot were seen being interviewed in jail. Bigfoot was voiced by Michael Patrick McGill.


== Martian Empire ==


=== Martian Commander X-2 ===

Martian Commander X-2 is the confident commander of the Martian military. He is never named outside his official capacity as the Commander (possibly High Commander) of the fleet of Mars. He essentially created Duck Dodgers by going back in time and making Dodgers a hero so as to not be proven wrong by the queen. X-2 is Duck Dodgers' archenemy, though X-2 considers Dodgers more of a nuisance than a true enemy. X-2 serves the Martian Queen Tyr'ahnee, with whom he is infatuated and loyal to. His crush is not requited for most of the series, until in the end of the second season, when the Queen kissed X2 in the cheek after learning of his crush, something he finds it so delighted. Even at their wedding, the Queen chooses Dodgers over X-2, even after X-2 risks his life to save Dodgers from the Legion of Duck Doom. Also, despite their rivalry with each other, both Dodgers and X-2 have worked together in several occasions to fight against more evil villains in general; even Dodgers manages to rescue X-2 from the wrath of the treacherous Martian General Z-9.
X-2's interests include piano music, singing, cooking, and possibly linguistics. He is also shown to be obsessively tidy and an avid worker. X-2 is also an avid scientist and inventor, creating many machines that assist the stories
X-2 is the primary villain/sinister character from the series.
Martian Commander X-2 was played by Marvin the Martian and was voiced by Joe Alaskey.


=== Queen Tyr'ahnee ===
The beautiful ruler of Mars, Queen Tyr'ahnee is shown as an incredibly competent ruler who, much unlike the rival President of Space, actually leaves the safety of the government buildings at times. Though at times she dislikes him, she is in love with Dodgers and, just like Cadet, believes him to be a true hero. She and Dodgers planned to marry until X-2 persuaded Dodgers to leave the Queen. She never quite got over her feelings for Dodgers, to the point of deserting Commander X-2 at their own wedding. She is shown to be good friends with I.Q. Hi, knowing and calling him by his first name, Ignatius, on many occasions.
Tyr'ahnee is something of a female version of X-2 and wears outfits reminiscent of ancient Egyptian royal garb. Her name is pronounced similar to "tyranny." She was voiced by Tia Carrere.


=== Commander K-9 ===
Commander K-9 is Martian Commander X-2's dog. He is loyal and loving and will do anything for his master. He'll always protect his master from danger,even if it makes K-9 look bad in front of him. K-9 is proven to be ticklish when Martian Gophers tickle his belly and chin. K-9's vocal effects were provided by Frank Welker.


=== Martian General Z-9 ===
Martian General Z-9 is a well-known general of the Martian military. He serves as the villain of the final two episodes of the second season. He initially served for the Martian Queen and Martian Commander X-2, but secretly plotted to take over both Earth and Mars as their new ruler after a peace meeting between Earth and Mars went off bad thanks to Dodgers' antics. To start off, Z-9 managed to capture Star Johnson after the latter learns of the general's plot. Z-9 then staged a military coup on Mars by taking the Martian Queen as prisoner and sending X-2 on the run as a wanted criminal, declaring himself the new Martian King and Commander. Z-9 then plans to get hold of the shut-down codes of Earth's shield system by staging up a false peace treaty between Mars and Earth to finalize his invasion on Earth. Fortunately, Duck Dodgers manages to rescue Cadet, X2, and Captain Johnson and they collaborated to keep the codes away to safety and save the Queen from Z-9's grasp during a battle between Z-9's forces and Earth. Following the aftermath of the battle between Earth and Mars which ended in ceasefire, Z-9 is arrested for his treason and crimes against Mars and Earth, and sacked of his ranks. He is currently incarcerated and sharing a cell with the Andromeda Annihilator, who subjects the former general to painful torture, much to his dismay. Z-9 was voiced by Corey Burton.


=== Dish ===
Dish is a female cyborg, serving as Martian General Z-9's loyal second-in-command and counselor. She aids him into overthrowing the Martian Queen and sending X-2 on the run to finalize his takeover of Mars. She's also capable in martial arts, and is shown once able to defeat a swarm of Instant Martians with her karate skills. In a battle between Earth's forces and Z-9's forces, Dish attempts to fire at the Protectorate HQ under Z-9's orders, but the Martian Queen, being freed by Dodgers and X-2, stops her by chopping her head off, killing her for good. Cadet then uses Dish's head to knock Z-9 out into the ship's console, thus leading to the general's defeat and imprisonment for his war crimes. Dish was voiced by Tara Strong.


=== Martian Centurion Robots ===
The Martian Centurion Robots are robotic servants of the Mars Empire. They appear to be sentient, and make up a large portion of the Imperial Army, while the organic Martians act as officers.

Dodgers frequently tries to destroy the clock in comedic fashion (smashing it with a hammer or golf club, or kicking it and stomping on it) but it continues to operate.
Happy Cat's catch phrase is a mirthless "HA! HA! HA!". This phrase and the character's name parodies Aku the Wizard from the Cartoon Network animated series Samurai Jack, which Dodgers portrays. Happy Cat's vocal effects were provided by veteran the late actor Mako.

When Dodgers and Cadet were visiting that planet on a diplomatic mission, they sided with opposing rulers on their musical opinions. This almost broke out into a civil war until both races shared the habit of making sure their planet doesn't break. After Duck Dodgers rammed their ship into Aquarium (though it was miraculously fixed), he and Cadet were suspended for causing civil war to break out and almost destroying Aquarium.
