God Shuffled His Feet is the second album by the Crash Test Dummies, released in 1993. It features their most popular single, "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm". The cover art superimposes the band members' faces over the figures of Titian's painting Bacchus and Ariadne. It was their most successful album commercially.


== ReceptionEdit ==
The album was the band's biggest mainstream hit. Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes the album's success to "Jerry Harrison's remarkably clear and focused production" and that "apart from the relatively concise pop smarts of the singles "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm" and "Afternoons and Coffeespoons," God Shuffled His Feet isn't all that different from the band's first album."


== Chart positionsEdit ==
God Shuffled His Feet was a number-one album in Austria and New Zealand, and also reached the top five in the national albums charts of numerous countries such as Australia, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. In addition, the album reached number six in the Netherlands national albums chart, number 2 in the UK Albums Chart, and number nine in the United States Billboard 200 albums chart. In their native Canada, it never reached higher than #17 on the national RPM charts, but fueled by the success of its four singles (all Top 20 hits there) the album eventually reached triple platinum status.
