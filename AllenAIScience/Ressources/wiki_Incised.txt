In geomorphology, the term Incised refers to when a river has cut downward through its riverbed. The river may have been incising through sediment or bedrock. The river begins at one elevation and incises downward through its bed while leaving its floodplain behind (higher). Although, it is possible for the floodplain to be lowered at the same time. Examples include Mobile Bay along the Gulf of Mexico.
