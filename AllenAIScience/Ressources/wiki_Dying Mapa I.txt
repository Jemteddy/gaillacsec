Dying Mapa I is an album by the Japanese noise band Merzbow, then consisting of Masami Akita and Kiyoshi Mizutani. This is the first installment of the Dying Mapa trilogy inspired by the Nyingmapa school of Tibetan Buddhism.
Musically, the whole trilogy is made with different equipment and instruments than other recordings of the same period. It also features instruments recorded on tape and then either slowed down or played backwards.
This album was later included on the 50-CD box set Merzbox on CD 15 along with the first half of Dying Mapa II.
