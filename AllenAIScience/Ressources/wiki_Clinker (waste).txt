Clinker is a general name given to waste from industrial processes — particularly those that involve smelting metals, burning fossil fuels and using a blacksmith's forge which will usually result in a large buildup of clinker around the tuyère. Clinker often forms a loose, black deposit that can consist of coke, coal, slag, charcoal, grit, and other waste materials.
Clinker may be reused for paving footpaths. It is laid and rolled, and forms a hard path with a rough surface.
Clinker often has a glassy look to it. It is much heavier than coke.


== EtymologyEdit ==
"Clinker" is from Dutch, and was originally used in English for bricks – see clinker brick. The term was later applied to hard residue, due to similar appearance.


== UsesEdit ==
In sewage treatment works, the water is first of all screened to remove floating debris. Then it is sedimented to remove small insoluble impurities. After this, it is sprayed over a filter bed of clinker, where microbes in the clinker kill harmful anaerobic bacteria in the water.
