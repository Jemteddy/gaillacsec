Meteorite finds are those meteorites that were found by people, but whose fall was not observed. They may have been on the surface of the Earth even for thousands of years and therefore can have varying amounts of weathering. They should be distinguished from meteorites called "falls", which were observed during their descent and collected shortly afterwards. All officially recognized meteorites are listed in the databases below, most of which have specimens in modern collections.
