Xantus Leaf-toed Gecko, or Leaf-toed gecko, refers to the species Phyllodactylus xanti, a gecko found in California and Mexico. It has vertical pupils, immovable eyelids, and leaf-like toe pads. The dorsal granular scales are interspersed with tubercles, and a brownish, grey or pinkish dorsum with a light venter.
It often squeaks when handled; it has a very fragile tail which is readily lost. This gecko is between 2.5 and 6.2 cm long.
The common name and its specific epithet commemorate John Xantus, a naturalist active in the United States of America. It is also referred to, ambiguously, as a Leaf-toed gecko. The accepted name and description were published in 1863 by E. D. Cope.
