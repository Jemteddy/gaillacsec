Super-Rabbit is a 1943 Warner Bros. cartoon starring Bugs Bunny who is parodying the popular comic book character Superman. Super-Rabbit was the 16th Bugs Bunny entry, and the 47th directed by Chuck Jones.


== PlotEdit ==
Professor Cannafraz creates a "super carrot" and uses it on his test subject – Rabbitus idioticus americanus (Bugs Bunny), who immediately wolfs down the proffered carrot. Armed with temporary superhero abilities that need to be replenished with additional super carrots, Bugs remembers a newspaper article about Texas hunter "Cottontail" Smith, who wants to hunt down all rabbits.
Bugs flies to Deepinaharta, Texas, and assumes the moniker of a mild-mannered forest creature, complete with oversized glasses and hat. He encounters Smith, who attempts to shoot Bugs. Bugs then hands him a cannon, eats another carrot then, upon being struck by the cannonball, plays basketball with it, quickly shoving Smith and his horse onto bleachers while he acts as his own cheerleader. After Bugs returns to the air, the bemused Smith and his horse fly into the sky with their own airplane. Bugs then snatches the shell of the plane away from them, plunging them to the ground.
Bugs runs out of power, but when he tries to recharge again, his carrots fall to the ground. When Bugs lands, he opens his eyes to see a line of chewed-up carrots eaten by Smith and his horse-turned-Superhero. Bugs turns to the camera and says "This looks like a job for a REAL Superman!" He ducks into a phone booth. Both Smith and the horse are ready to attack - until the booth opens and they both snap to attention and salute. Bugs marches out in a Marine uniform, singing “The Marines Hymn.” He dismisses the two, claiming he has "important work to do!", and marches off to "Berlin, Tokyo and points East." 


== ReceptionEdit ==
The U.S. Marine Corps were so thrilled that Bugs Bunny decided to become a Marine in this cartoon, and they insisted the character to be officially inducted into the force as a private, which was done, complete with dogtags. The character was regularly promoted until Bugs was officially "discharged" at the end of World War II as a Master Sergeant.
Cottontail Smith later appears as one of Yosemite Sam’s sidekicks in Looney Tunes: Back in Action. The character’s voice is a less raucous version of Sam’s and Foghorn Leghorn’s.

== AnalysisEdit ==
The short parodies the Superman animated series as a figure soars over a skyscraper. Onlookers are heard speculating on its nature: "Look! Up there in the sky" "It’s a boid" [bird], "No, it ain’t a boid, it’s a dive-bommah".
A Marine is described as "a real superman" by Bugs.
