== Live performance ==
The song is frequently played live, most recently as a combination with Queen's "We Will Rock You" during the first chorus. It is the only song from See You on the Other Side that has remained a staple of their live set. It has also been performed several times on television, including Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Spike TV's Scream Awards.


== Music video ==
The video was directed by Little X, his second time behind the lens for a rock band. The video begins with Korn performing in a desert in broad daylight. The sky begins to shatter like glass during the chorus to reveal a night sky. Later, the whole background shatters, leaving a plain white background. Lastly, they literally become undone while continuing to perform, and as they do, they resemble slinkies. The band is completely unraveled and gone by the ending of the video.


== Appearances in media ==
Former Detroit Tigers third baseman Brandon Inge used the song as his walkup song when batting. It was also used as the walkup song for Hunter Pence when he played for the Philadelphia Phillies. It was also featured in a commercial for the CBS crime drama series, Criminal Minds, and in the video game, Blitz: The League. An instrumental version is used for the TNA wrestler, Frankie Kazarian, also known as Kaz. It also appeared in VH1's 100 most shocking music moments in the discussion of the Woodstock 1999; both "Did My Time" and "Coming Undone" are heard in the background.

== Mashup ==
Korn and Atlanta crunk rappers Dem Franchize Boyz did a mash-up of their respective hit singles at the time, "Coming Undone" and "Lean wit It, Rock wit It", titled "Coming Undone wit It". It was produced by Jermaine Dupri and Scott Spock from The Matrix, and was first released on AOL in April 2006. A video for "Coming Undone wit It" was released on the DVD portion of Chopped, Screwed, Live and Unglued. This is the official remix to both songs.
Various elements of the two songs were combined with new parts exclusive to the mashup, produced by Scott Spock of The Matrix.

"It's all energy; Crunk music's like heavy hip-hop, so it mixes right. It's perfect ... The songs are at almost the same tempo and I knew it would work right off. So we hooked up with the boys ... and they're talented. It's fun and just different." – Jonathan Davis
