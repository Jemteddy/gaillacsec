China's electric motor industry has been developed for 60 years. Most manufacturers produce low power and small-size motors. Small motor manufacturers are mostly located in Zhejiang province, Fujian province, and Guangdong province. Only a few motor manufacturers produces high power and large-size motors, for example Wannan Motor.
High power and large-size motors are often used in rolling mills, etc. In the last, ABB and Siemens large-size motors took a large market shares in China. However, ABB and Simens motor often have very high sale prices so that some rolling mills cannot afford. They need domestic large-size motors instead of ABB motors. Currently, those rolling mills can buy from domestic motor manufacturers which can produce such large-size motors.
