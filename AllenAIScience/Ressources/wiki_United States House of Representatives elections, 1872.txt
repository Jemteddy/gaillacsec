Elections to the United States House of Representatives were held in 1872 and 1873 for representatives to the 43rd Congress, coinciding with the re-election of President Ulysses S. Grant.
Grant's Republican Party increased its majority greatly at the expense of the opposition Democratic Party. The pro-industry outlook of the Republicans appealed to many Northern voters, especially as the post-war economy exploded, and this allowed the party to flourish as the Industrial Revolution grew more widespread. The Republicans also benefited from a continuing association with Civil War victory as well as disarray amongst Democratic leadership.


== Election summaries ==
Following the 1870 Census, the House was reapportioned, initially adding 40 seats, followed by a subsequent amendment to the apportionment act adding another seat to 9 States, resulting in a total increase of 49 seats. No States lost seats, 10 States had no change, 13 States gained 1 seat each, 9 States gained 2 seats, 3 States gained 3 seats, 1 State gained 4 seats, and 1 State gained 5 Seats. Prior to the supplemental act, two States (New Hampshire and Vermont) had each lost 1 seat. This was the first reapportionment after the repeal of the three-fifths compromise by the 14th Amendment


== Election dates ==
In 1845, Congress passed a law providing for a uniform nationwide date for choosing Presidential electors. This law did not affect election dates for Congress, which remained within the jurisdiction of State governments, but over time, the States moved their Congressional elections to this date as well. In 1872–73, there were still 9 states with earlier election dates, and 2 states with later election dates:
Early elections (1872):
June 4 Oregon
August 1 North Carolina
August 27 West Virginia
September 3 Vermont
September 9 Maine
October 8 Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania

Late elections (1873):
March 11, 1873 New Hampshire
April 7, 1873 Connecticut
