Atteva zebra is a moth of the Yponomeutidae family. It is known only from Costa Rica and Panama.
The larvae feed on shoot tips of Simarouba amara saplings and adult trees. It is more abundant than Atteva pustulella, but may be found on the same individual tree with A. pustulella and an occasional Atteva aurea in anthropogenic rain forest habitats. It has never been found on Simarouba glauca.
