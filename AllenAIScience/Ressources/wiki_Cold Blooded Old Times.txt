"Cold Blooded Old Times" is the second single by Bill Callahan (also known as Smog) from his 1999-album Knock Knock. The B-sides, "Chosen One" and "I Break Horses", were recorded in a Peel Session and broadcast on November 12, 1997. The Peel Session players were Callahan (guitar, vocal), Jason Dezember (drums) and Colin Gagon (piano). The acoustic version of "Cold Blooded Old Times" was recorded by Phil Bonnet.
"Cold Blooded Old Times" appeared in the film High Fidelity, making it one of Smog's best known songs. "Chosen One (Peel Session)", "I Break Horses (Peel Session)" and "Cold Blooded Old Times (acoustic)" later appeared on Smog's rarities compilation, Accumulation: None.
The Peel Session version of Chosen One is a remake of a previous version found on the 1993 album, Julius Caesar.
