Take a Break is the fourth album by Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, released on July 1, 2003, on Fat Wreck Chords independent record label.
The album consists entirely of cover versions of R&B songs. Like its predecessor, Blow in the Wind, several tracks are led off with appropriations of classic punk (or related genres like new wave) riffs ("Crazy" incorporates "Six Pack" by Black Flag, "Save the Best for Last" includes "Pretty Vacant" by The Sex Pistols, and "I'll Be There" borrows the intro from The Cars' "Just What I Needed").
