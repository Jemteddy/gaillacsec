The Savage Land Mutates are a fictional Marvel Comics supervillain group based in the Savage Land, a hidden Antarctic environment of dinosaurs and primitive people in the Marvel Universe.


== Fictional team biography ==
The Savage Land Mutates were originally Swamp Men (human inhabitants of the Savage Land) that were genetically altered by the mutant Magneto to serve as his troops. They clashed with the X-Men and Ka-Zar on different occasions. On one occasion, they turned Spider-Man into the Man-Spider and Angel into a bird monster. They have also encountered the Avengers. Although the group is fairly large, most appearances of the group contain only about half of the group's members, usually under leadership of Sauron, Brainchild, or Zaladane. The entire group has never appeared together at one time.
After Sauron escaped from the Raft during a jailbreak concocted by the Skrulls, the Avengers believed he and the Mutates were responsible for the breakout and pursued him to the Savage Land.
Amphibius later tells Sauron and the other Savage Land Mutates that Magneto's Asteroid M has risen from the sea, but they didn't want to go find him. Worm took control of Barbarus, Lupo, and Sauron and commandeered a ship to go find Magneto. When threatened by the Japanese military, Sauron attacked an armored car causing an international incident. Cannonball, Sunspot, and Warlock investigated and found the Savage Land Mutates on the deck of the ship. Cannonball fought Sauron in the skies while Karma discovered that the Savage Land Mutates were immune to her powers of psychic persuasion. Cannonball managed to defeat Sauron while the other New Mutants defeated the Savage Land Mutates. Upon learning why the Savage Land Mutates were on the ship, Karma told Worm, Sauron, Barbarus, and Lupo that they were in charge of Asteroid M and Magneto. Worm then orders the Savage Land Mutates to return to the Savage Land.


== Membership ==


=== Leaders ===
The following have been depicted as leaders of the Savage Land Mutates:


==== Magneto ====
Magneto is the creator and first leader of the Savage Land Mutates.


==== Zaladane ====
Within the context of the stories, Zaladane is the warlike high priestess and queen of the Sun People, who live in the Savage Land. She attempts to lead the Sun People in a war to conquer the peoples of the Savage Land. Her army's weapons are destroyed by Garokk, so she attempts to force Garokk to do her bidding. She is defeated by Ka-Zar and seemingly destroyed. Zaladane later reappears, and magically transforms her captive Kirk Marston into Garokk, endowing him with the original Garokk's consciousness. She aids Garokk in attempting to unite the Savage Land tribes under his leadership, capturing the X-Men and Ka-Zar. She is thwarted by the X-Men. Years later, Zaladane became the assistant of the High Evolutionary in his project to restore the Savage Land after its near destruction by the alien Terminus. In her quest for power she, with the help of the Mutate Worm, enslaves many of the land's natives and abducts Polaris to steal her magnetic powers. Zaladane leads an army in an attempt to conquer the Savage Land, but is defeated by Ka-Zar and the X-Men. With Polaris' magnetic powers, Zaladane later takes over the Savage Land. She leads her army and the Savage Land mutates against Magneto, Ka-Zar, Rogue, Nick Fury, and S.H.I.E.L.D. forces in the Savage Land. She is defeated and executed by Magneto, who impales her.


==== Sauron ====
Sauron is a life-force draining human who transforms into a mind controlling, savage Pteranodon-like creature if he feeds on mutant energy.
