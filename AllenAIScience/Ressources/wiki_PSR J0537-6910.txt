PSR J0537-6910 is a pulsar that is 4,000 years old (plus light travel time to Earth), and about 170,000 light-years away, in the southern sky. It rotates at 62 Hertz.
Astronomer John Middleditch and his team at LANL have become the first people to predict starquakes; and observe magnetic pole drift on a pulsar; using this pulsar with observational data from Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer.
