Skeletal pneumaticity is the presence of air spaces within bones. It is generally produced during development by excavation of bone by pneumatic diverticula (air sacs) from an air-filled space such as the lungs or nasal cavity. Pneumatization is highly variable between individuals, and bones not normally pneumatized can become pneumatized in pathological development.


== Cranial pneumaticityEdit ==
Pneumatization occurs in the skulls of mammals, crocodilians and birds among extant tetrapods. Pneumatization has been documented in extinct archosaurs including dinosaurs and pterosaurs. Pneumatic spaces include the paranasal sinuses and some of the mastoid cells.


== Postcranial pneumaticityEdit ==
Postcranial pneumaticity is found largely in certain archosaur groups, namely dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and birds. Vertebral pneumatization is widespread among saurischian dinosaurs, and some theropods have quite widespread pneumatization -- Aerosteon riocoloradensis has pneumatization of the ilium, furcula, and gastralia as well. Many modern birds are extensively pneumatized. The air pockets of the bones are connected to the pulmonary air sacs:
However the extent of pneumaticity depends on species. For example it is slight in diving birds, loons lack pneumatic bones at all.
Postcranial pneumatization is rarer outside of Archosauria. Examples include the hyoid in howler monkeys Alouatta, and the dorsal vertebrae in the osteoglossiform fish Pantodon. Slight pneumatization of the centra and rib heads by dorsal diverticula in the lungs of land tortoises has also been documented. In addition, pathological pneumatization has been known to occur in the human atlas vertebra.
