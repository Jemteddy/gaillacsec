The official seal of the President of Ukraine is ring-shaped. There is an image of the lesser Coat of Arms of Ukraine in the center of the stamp hemmed with the “The President of Ukraine” inscription. Below the National Emblem one can see an image of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise. The handle of the new seal is garnished with a lapis lazuli ball. The neck or central part of the seal is gilded; its color spectrum goes in line with the national Flag of Ukraine – blue above and yellow below. The seal is made of silver and weighs next to half a kilo. It is known that Kyiv jeweler Mykhailo Cheburakhin made it using sketches by Oleksiy Rudenko just for a week.
