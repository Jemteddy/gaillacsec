"Don't the Girls All Get Prettier at Closing Time" is a song written by Baker Knight, and recorded by American country music artist Mickey Gilley. It was released in January 1976 as the first single from the album Gilley's Smokin. The song was Gilley's fifth No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. The song's one week atop the chart was part of a 12-week stay in the country chart's top 40.

The song is a lament about loneliness and late-night desperation in finding a desirable significant other in a barroom. It caught the attention of social psychologists who used scientific testing to investigate whether individuals begin to perceive the opposite gender as being more attractive as it gets later into the night. The phenomenon became known as the "closing time effect".
