A Wartenberg wheel, also called a Wartenberg pinwheel or Wartenberg neurowheel, is a medical device for neurological use. It was originally designed by Robert Wartenberg to test nerve reactions (sensitivity) as it rolled systematically across the skin. A Wartenberg wheel is generally made of stainless steel with a handle of approximately seven inches in length. The wheel, which has evenly spaced radiating sharp pins, rotates as it is rolled across the flesh. A disposable plastic version is available. Because of hygienic concerns, these devices are rarely used any more.
The Wartenberg wheel is also used as a BDSM or sensation sex toy, sometimes while connected to a violet wand electrical device.
Another version is used in clothing pattern making to transfer markings from fabric to paper, called a pounce wheel. They are similar in shape but have wooden handles.
