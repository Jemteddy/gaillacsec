== History ==
Glenwood Springs was originally known as "Defiance", a name sometimes still used by local teams or businesses. Defiance was established in 1883, a camp of tents, saloons, and brothels with an increasing amount of cabins and lodging establishments. It was populated with the expected crowd of gamblers, gunslingers, and prostitutes. Town Founder Isaac Cooper's wife Sarah was having a hard time adjusting to the frontier life and in an attempt to make her environment somewhat more comfortable, persuaded the founders to change the name to Glenwood Springs, Colorado, after her beloved hometown of Glenwood, Iowa.

Its location at the confluence of the Colorado River and the Roaring Fork River as well as gaining a stop on the railroad historically made it a center of commerce in the area. The city has seen famous visitors including President Teddy Roosevelt who spent an entire summer vacation living out of the historic Hotel Colorado. Doc Holliday, a wild west legend from the O.K. Corral gunfight, spent the final months of his life in Glenwood Springs and is buried in the town's original Pioneer Cemetery above Bennett Avenue. Infamous serial killer Ted Bundy was imprisoned in the Glenwood Springs jail until he escaped on the night of December 30, 1977, an escape which went undetected for 17 hours. Glenwood Springs was one of the first places in the United States to have electric lights. The original lighting was installed in 1897 inside of the Fairy Caves in Iron mountain. Eventually a dam was built in Glenwood Canyon providing water for the Shoshone power plant. The plant began producing power on May 16, 1909.


== Geography ==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 4.8 square miles (12 km2), of which, 4.8 square miles (12 km2) of it is land and 0.21% is water.

Glenwood Springs is one of the most walkable towns in America, a distinction that has been recognized by PBS and Walking Magazine, including in the Walking Town Hall of Fame.
The town itself is situated in the river valleys at the confluence of the Colorado River and the Roaring Fork River. The area surrounding Glenwood Springs is steeply contoured on all sides with numerous caves to be found.


== Climate ==
Glenwood Springs has a generally mild and semi-arid climate, much more consistently stable than that of the Front Range and most of Colorado, though still decidedly continental and prone to periods of extreme weather.
While not as consistently fecund as the extensive agricultural and viticultural areas nearby at lower altitude such as Palisade, most types of fruit and vegetable do very well in the light and soil if generously watered, particularly stonefruit such as cherries, peaches, and plums, pomaceous fruit such as apples and pears, and grapes.
Microclimates dominate Glenwood Springs, with areas close to the rivers often much more damp and cool than hillsides.

== Economy ==
Glenwood Springs' economy has centered on hospitality for vacationers since its foundation, unlike many of Colorado's mountain towns, which were generally settled for mining or railroad purposes. While early railroad access and inclusion on main lines and proximity to Aspen certainly boosted the city's prospects, Glenwood Springs consistently attracted visitors, and thus never really experienced the bust or quiet years most mountain towns endured.
Much of this tourism, particularly during the summer months, typically involves local outdoor sports or the amenities of the town. In the winter, the proximity of Glenwood Springs to multiple major ski resorts and its hot springs draw visitors as well. Autumn is scenic as the gambel oaks studding the hillsides change color, and spring brings a tide of violas and other flowers, particularly bulbs, from traditional daffodils to native sego lilies.
Historically, Glenwood Springs has been most visited by residents of other parts of Colorado, but tourism from the rest of America and the world has been the most rapid source of growth recently.
Glenwood Springs also serves as a bedroom community for Aspen and Vail, while many people who work in Glenwood Springs in turn live further down the Valley.
Bloomberg Business named Glenwood Springs the 7th wealthiest small town in America in 2015.
Further growth is expected to be slow due to severe geographic constraints and, if further population growth is to be accommodated, it must come primarily from multifamily infill development.


== Education ==
Glenwood Springs is the headquarters of the Roaring Fork RE-1 school district and the Colorado Mountain College. In all, the city has 5 public K-12 schools: Glenwood Springs High School, Yampah Mountain High School (an alternative school not part of RE-1), Glenwood Springs Middle School, Glenwood Springs Elementary School, and Sopris Elementary School. St. Stephen's Catholic Elementary School, which was founded in 1982, is K-8.
