Simply Raw: Reversing Diabetes in 30 Days is a 2009 American independent documentary film which examines the effect of a raw food diet on diabetes.

The film follows six diabetics, who eat nothing but raw vegan food for a period of 30 days. Their progress and health are monitored by a team of medics. The film shows all six participants demonstrating reduced insulin dependence and blood-sugar levels.

== Production ==
Raw foods advocate Michael Bedar was inspired to create Simply Raw after a meeting with raw food advocate Gabriel Cousens in 2003. The entire project took place at Cousen's Tree of Life Rejouvenation Centre, under Cousen's direction. It received funding from the Movement to Reverse Diabetes Naturally (RDN).


== Reception ==
DVD Talk noted the film as "inspiring for demonstrating what can be achieved through extreme diet modification", but cautioned that as healthful as a dietary change could be, "the practical application of this documentary is limited because few American diabetics would be willing to so radically alter their conventional diets rich in meat, processed food, and empty calories even if the benefit for doing so is a healthy, longer life."
