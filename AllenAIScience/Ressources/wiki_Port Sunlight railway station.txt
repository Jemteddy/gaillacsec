Port Sunlight railway station serves the Port Sunlight area of the Wirral, England, a model village built for the workers of the nearby Lever Brothers soap factory. The station is situated on the Chester and Ellesmere Port branches of the Wirral Line, part of the Merseyrail network.


== History ==
Port Sunlight station is on the former Chester and Birkenhead Railway, which opened in 1838.
Direct train services to Liverpool began in 1985, when the line between Rock Ferry and Hooton was electrified; previously passengers for Liverpool had to change at Rock Ferry. Further electrification in early 1990s allowed electric train services to be extended, first to Chester in 1993 and then Ellesmere Port in 1994.


== Facilities ==
The station is staffed, during all opening hours, and has platform CCTV. There are toilets, a payphone, a vending machine and a booking office. There are departure and arrival screens, on the platform, for passenger information. Each of the two platforms has sheltered seating. The station doesn't have a car park, though there is roadside parking available. The station does have a cycle rack with 8 spaces, and a secure cycle locker with 60 spaces. Access to the station booking office is by steep ramp. However, there is no easy access for passengers with wheelchairs or prams to the platforms, as this is by subway and staircase only. Platform access has not been modernised to the standard of that at Hooton.


== Services ==
Trains operate every 15 minutes between Chester and Liverpool on weekdays and Saturdays until late evening when the service becomes half-hourly, as it is on Sundays. Additionally there is a half-hourly service between Liverpool and Ellesmere Port all day, every day. Northbound trains operate via Hamilton Square station in Birkenhead and the Mersey Railway Tunnel to Liverpool. Southbound trains all proceed as far as Hooton, where the lines to Chester and Ellesmere Port divide. These services are all provided by Merseyrail's fleet of Class 507 and Class 508 EMUs.
