Iosono is the product name of an audio system presented by the Fraunhofer Institute and the Iosono GmbH in 2004. It is based on wave field synthesis, a method to use secondary audio sources to recreate primary wave fields, that was developed at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands in the 1980s.
Given a 3D audio "picture" of the scene, a specialised algorithm generates secondary sound waves necessary to recreate it in the particular room and then instructs a large number of speakers (300-400) to generate the "audio hologram". While traditional surround sound systems can only recreate the original 3D sound in a small "sweet spot", Iosono claims it can recreate the original audio in the whole room.
