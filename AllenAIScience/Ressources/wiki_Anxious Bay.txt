Anxious Bay is a bay located on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula, South Australia about 275 kilometres (171 mi) west north-west of Adelaide. It was named by Matthew Flinders on 21 February 1802. It is one of four ‘historic bays’ located on the South Australian coast.


== Extent & description ==
Anxious Bay lies between Cape Radstock and Cape Finniss on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula. Anxious Bay itself is the entry point for the following minor coastal inlets from west to east - Baird Bay and Venus Bay. It is one of four bays on the South Australian coast considered by the Australian government to be a ‘historic bay’ under the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 and proclaimed as such in 1987 and again in 2006 with the result that the mouth of the bay is on the territorial seas baseline and the waters within the bay are internal waters as per the definition used in United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Matthew Flinders named Anxious Bay on 11 February 1802.
