Kobuk Valley Wilderness is a wilderness area in Alaska, United States. It is part of the Kobuk Valley National Park. The wilderness lies 26 miles (42 km) north of the Arctic Circle and enclosed by the Baird Mountains and Waring Mountains mountains, the climate has changed little (or not at all) since the late Pleistocene era. Remnant flora grow as reminders of the vast Arctic steppe tundra that once bridged present-day Alaska and Asia.
