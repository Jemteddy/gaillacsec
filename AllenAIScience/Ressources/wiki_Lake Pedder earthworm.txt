"Hypolimnus" redirects here. The butterfly genus Hypolimnas is often misspelled thus.

The Lake Pedder Earthworm (Hypolimnus pedderensis) was an earthworm species in the family Megascolecidae. Its genus Hypolimnus is monotypic.
It was endemic to the Lake Pedder area in Tasmania, Australia, prior to its flooding in 1972 for a hydro-electric power scheme.
It is only known from a specimen collected from a Lake Pedder beach in 1971. A 1996 survey failed to find it and it is presumed extinct.
