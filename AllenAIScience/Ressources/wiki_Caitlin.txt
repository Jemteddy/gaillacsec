Caitlyn or Caitlín (anglicized as Katelynn) is an Irish female given name. Along with the many other variants of Katherine, it is generally believed to mean "pure" because of its long association with the Greek adjective καθαρός katharos (pure), though the name did not evolve from this word. The name originated in Ireland as Caitlín [ˈkatʲlʲiːnʲ] and is the Irish variation of the Old French name Cateline [katlin], which was derived from Catherine, which was derived from the Ancient Greek Αἰκατερίνη (Aikaterine). Catherine is attributed to St. Catherine of Alexandria.- The name also means torture, which is Gaelic.


== Variations ==
Historically, only the spellings Caitlín, Caitlin, Caitlyn and the (anglicised) form Kathleen were used. In the 1970s, however, people began pronouncing the name as KAYT-lin, which led to numerous variations in spelling., including Kaitlin, Katelyn, Catelyn, Catelin, Caitlyn, etc.
