The Forrest H. Dutlinger Natural Area is a protected area in Clinton County, Pennsylvania that includes a 158-acre (64 ha) old-growth forest of Eastern Hemlock, American Beech, Black Cherry, Sugar Maple, and Northern Red Oak. There are also Eastern White Pines, but a few were selectively logged around 1900. The largest tree is an Eastern Hemlock, 43 inches (110 cm) diameter at breast height and 112 feet (34 m) tall.
The old-growth forest once lay on the boundary of two lumber companies, the Goodyear and Lackawanna, but was apparently spared because of a dispute over a surveying error.
Forrest Dutlinger was a forester for the state of Pennsylvania from 1909 to 1959, beginning his career at a time of massive clear cutting of forests with out any reforestation by the timber companies. Major fires were widespread and very common due to most machinery being steam driven and the fires used to boil the water would ignite the surrounding area. Dutlinger also watched helpless as the Asian chestnut blight killed all the American Chestnut trees in a matter of years. The Chestnut was the most common hardwood tree in the forest at the time and its magnificent lumber and nuts as a food source for wildlife has never been replaced.
