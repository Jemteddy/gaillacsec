Platydesma is a genus of plants in family Rutaceae. Evidence from 2009 indicates that Platydesma is nested within the related genus Melicope and is sister to all Hawaiian Melicope species. And while Melicope species are dioecious (individual plants only bear either male or female flowers), the flowers of Platydesma are hermaphroditic, suggesting a rare evolutionary reversion away from dioecy in Platydesma. While they have no medicinal purposes; the board of water supply states that they can be used for a shrub. Species include:
Platydesma cornuta
Platydesma remyi
Platydesma rostrata
Platydesma spathulata
