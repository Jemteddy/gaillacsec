== Reception ==
Reviews were negative. Joe Leyden of Variety wrote "It's not quite awful enough to qualify as camp, which may work against its finding any audience", and credited it with actors with "more sincerity than talent", but a script which "buries its one good idea". Philip Martin of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette wrote, "...the cinematic equivalent of a Jack Chick cartoon tract, a modestly artful form of proselytizing," but "one hopes the people who enjoy this sort of thing will find it."
