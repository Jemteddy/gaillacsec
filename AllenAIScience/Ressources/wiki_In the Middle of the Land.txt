"In the Middle of the Land" was a single by iconic Australian rock group Hoodoo Gurus. It was released on Big Time Records in 1987; and was written by Dave Faulkner. "Hayride to Hell, part 2 (The Showdown)", the B-side, was also written by Faulkner.

"... was written about one of my pet subjects: evangelical preachers and their hypocrisy. As a later song of mine says, 'Follow any creed / If my freedom's guaranteed / I don't mind.'" - Dave Faulkner.
