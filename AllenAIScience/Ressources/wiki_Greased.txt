Greased is an EP by Less Than Jake featuring songs from the musical Grease including "Summer Nights", "You're The One That I Want" and "Greased Lightning"'. Greased has been released twice - the first release was discontinued to avoid a lawsuit with Paramount Pictures (who own the rights to the film) and Universal Music Group (who own the rights to the songs featured in the film Grease), and the second was released several months later after a deal had been reached. The re-release featured different artwork (pictured on the right).
