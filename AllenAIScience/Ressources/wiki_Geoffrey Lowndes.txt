William Geoffrey Lowndes Frith Lowndes (born William Geoffrey Lowndes Frith; 24 January 1898 â€“ 23 May 1982), known as Geoffrey Lowndes, was an English cricketer who played for Oxford University, Hampshire and the Marylebone Cricket Club. Lowndes was a right-handed batsman and bowled right-arm medium-fast.
The son of cricketer William Frith, Lowndes changed his name from "William Geoffrey Lowndes Frith" to "William Geoffrey Lowndes Frith Lowndes" in July 1906. He made his first class debut in 1921 for Oxford University against the Free Foresters. In 1924 he joined Hampshire, and played for them to 1935, captaining the side in 1934 and 1935. Lowndes also made five appearances for the Marylebone Cricket Club between 1928 and 1934. His final first-class appearance was a mirror to his debut match; Oxford University played the Free Foresters, but this time he played against the university.
Lowndes died in 1982 in Newbury at the age of 84.
