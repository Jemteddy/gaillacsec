Therapeutic angiogenesis is an experimental area of treatment of ischemia, the condition which associated with decrease in blood supply to certain body organs, tissue or part This usually caused by constriction or obstruction of the blood vessels. Angiogenesis is the natural healing process by which new blood vessels are formed to supply the organ or part in deficit with oxygen-rich blood. The goal of therapeutic angiogenesis is to stimulate the creation of new blood vessels in ischemic organs, tissues or parts in hope to increase the level of oxygen-rich blood reaching these areas.
