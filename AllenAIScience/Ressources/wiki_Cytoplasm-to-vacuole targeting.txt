Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) is an autophagy-related pathway in yeast. Under vegetative conditions it delivers hydrolases, such as aminopeptidase 1 (Ape1), to the vacuole. This makes the cvt pathway the only known biosynthetic pathway to utilize the machinery of autophagy for operation.


== Nomenclature ==
The abbreviation Cvt comes from the emphasis Cytoplasm vacuole targeting, not from Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting.
