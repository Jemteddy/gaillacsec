== Newspapers ==
McDonald has been home to a few newspapers in its history. "The Record" and "The Outlook" were early papers that became "The Record-Outlook." "The Record-Outlook" eventually came to be owned by The Observer Publishing Company of Washington, PA. After several years under this ownership, it was merged with The Burgettstown Enterprise and became "The Record-Enterprise." This paper closed in 1999.
From 2000 to 2002 The Community Outlook Newspaper filled the void of losing the local paper for McDonald and surrounding areas. DIVA Publishing headed by Stefanie Crawford, Isaac Holeva and Karla Hons published the 32 page periodical in over 20 communities with its base focusing on McDonald and surrounding neighborhoods.
Since then, some business owners along the borough's main streets have periodically attempted to begin community newsletters or newspapers to assist in the promotion of local commerce. The current attempt, first published in 2009, is called the "McDonald Area News."
