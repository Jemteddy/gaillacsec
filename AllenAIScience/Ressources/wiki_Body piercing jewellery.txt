Body piercing jewellery is jewellery manufactured specifically for use in body piercing.
Originally, hardly any other jewellery than circular earrings were used in modern Western body piercing. As the body piercing became more of a fashion, a vast amount of specially crafted jewellery became available. Common types of body jewellery now include barbells, captive bead rings, labrets, navel rings, plugs, spirals, and many more. Materials used for production have grown from traditional gold and silver to widespread use of surgical steel as well as titanium, niobium, glass, several kinds of plastics (PTFE, tygon, bioplast, nylon), wood, horn, amber, stone, bamboo, silicone, fossilized ivories, tusks and other bones, and even porcelain. With so many different materials being used, body jewellery can be of some very unusual designs.
