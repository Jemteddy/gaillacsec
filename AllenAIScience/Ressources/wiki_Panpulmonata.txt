Panpulmonata is a taxonomic clade of snails and slugs in the clade Heterobranchia within the clade Euthyneura.
Panpulmonata was established as a new taxon by Jörger et al. in October 2010.
The older name "Pulmonata" referred to a group of gastropods which were considered to be "air-breathers". This meaning certainly does not apply to the panpulmonate groups Acochlidia, Sacoglossa and Pyramidelloidea, and also was inaccurate when applied to some of the more traditional pulmonate taxa such as Siphonarioidea or Hygrophila, most members of which lack permanently air-filled lungs. However, the term Panpulmonata was chosen by Jörger et al. (2010) to provide some continuity in the terminology. Panpulmonata consists of following taxa:
Siphonarioidea
Sacoglossa
Glacidorboidea
Amphiboloidea
Pyramidelloidea
Hygrophila
Acochlidiacea (mentioned as Acochlidia)
Eupulmonata: Stylommatophora, Systellommatophora, Ellobioidea, Otinoidea, Trimusculoidea.
