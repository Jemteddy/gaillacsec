Eleanour Sophy Sinclair Rohde (1881â€“1950) was a British gardener, garden historian, and horticultural writer.


== Life and works ==

For much of her life she lived in a slightly larger than average detached house but with a much larger than average garden, Cranham Lodge, Reigate. She collected unusual herb and vegetable varieties, and also worked as a garden designer. One of her most visited designs was the herb garden for Lullingstone Castle in west Kent, England. Her work did much to encourage the modern popularity of herb gardens, her most acclaimed work being The Scented Garden (1931).
