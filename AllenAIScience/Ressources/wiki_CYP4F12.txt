Cytochrome P450 4F12 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CYP4F12 gene.
This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. This protein likely localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. When expressed in yeast the enzyme is capable of oxidizing arachidonic acid; however, its physiological function has not been determined. This gene is part of a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes on chromosome 19.
