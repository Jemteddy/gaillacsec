Anti-Gravity Yoga or "aerial yoga", is a new type of yoga, originating in New York but now being practised in several countries, which combines the traditional yoga poses, pilates and dance with the use of a hammock.


== The hammock ==
Anti-gravity yoga requires a special kind of hammock which can support up to 300 kilos of weight. The rig consists of support chains, a webbing strap, a silk hammock and carabiners.
Two support chains hang down from the ceiling to less than one meter from the floor, and the hammock is connected at the height preferred by the user, normally between waist and shoulder.
The hammock acts like a swing or soft trapeze, supporting the hips for forward bends and back bends. Yoga postures which some find difficult to do on the ground, such as the reverse post, may be easier in mid-air using the hammock, and the hammock moves add variety to a workout.


== Health benefits claimed for Anti-gravity yoga ==
There is a lack of well-designed clinical trials to support the effectiveness of yoga in improving general health, and ant-gravity yoga is too new to have been studied in this way. However, anecdotal evidence indicates that by facilitating bending and stretching of the whole body during exercise, muscles and joints will be strengthened and rehabilitated, and the spine decompressed as the body hangs freely. As with other forms of active exercise, the circulatory, respiratory and digestive systems are improved through increased blood circulation. Yoga in general, and anti-gravity yoga in particular is promoted as benefiting emotional, psychological and spiritual health.
