== Plot ==
The Deep: Here be Dragons is an original Graphic Novel in which we meet the Nekton family, a family who have been exploring the seas for generations. Here Be Dragons sees the Nekton family aboard their state-of-the-art submarine, The Arronax, following strange reports of monster sightings all the way to Greenland. What they discover in those dark depths may change their perceptions of the ocean forever…


== A Diverse Family ==
The Nekton family are notable for their multicultural makeup, a rarity in western comic books. The family is composed of a black father, an Asian mother, and their two children. When asked about the make-up of the protagonists in an interview for MTV Geek, writer Tom Taylor had this to say, "The world is a diverse place and not every family of heroes looks like The Incredibles. We haven't made a big deal of this in The Deep. We simply wanted a unique cast of heroes who aren't from anywhere. Their ethnicity and countries of origin aren't talked about or pointed out in the book at all. The sea is huge and covers the globe, and so do the Nekton family."
