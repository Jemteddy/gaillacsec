The deep temporal arteries, two in number, anterior and posterior, ascend between the temporalis and the pericranium.
They supply the muscle, and anastomose with the middle temporal artery.
The anterior communicates with the lacrimal artery by means of small branches which perforate the zygomatic bone and great wing of the sphenoid.
