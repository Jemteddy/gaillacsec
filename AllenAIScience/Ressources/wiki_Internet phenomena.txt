An Internet phenomenon is a phenomenon - a person, entity, or idea - that achieves popularity primarily through the dissemination of information on the Internet. The best-known forms of Internet phenomena are the Internet meme, the Internet celebrity, and successful websites. For example, in 2006, InformationWeek described how Pierre Omidyar's creation of the website eBay, after finding a person who collected broken laser pointers, led to its becoming an "Internet phenomenon".
