Thomas Purcell, Baron of Loughmoe (1538 – August 3, 1609) was an Irish nobleman.
A member of a wealthy Tipperary family, Thomas' greatest legacy is a harp composition he commissioned to be played at his funeral. The lament was probably commissioned by Purcell for his impending death. According to harp historian Edward Bunting, Purcell made his last will on 26 March 1597, John Scott composed his lament in 1599, and the Baron died on 3 August 1607.
The correct Irish title for this piece would seem to be 'Cumha Bharúin Loch Mór' (the lament of/for the baron of Loughmore), a title which is found in Bunting manuscript 29 f111v as 'Cooee Vareen Lagh Moor', dictated, it would seem, from harper Denis O'Hampsey. However, the Irish for 'Baron of Lochmoe' appears to have been given in the Annals of the Four Masters as 'Barún Luachmaighi'.
The piece is titled 'Cumha Caoine an Albanaigh', or in English, 'Scott's Lamentation', in Bunting's 1840 publication, 'The Ancient Music of Ireland'. This incorrect Irish title seems a reverse translation of 'Scott's Lamentation' (i.e., Cumha an Albanaigh) with the word 'caoine' (lamenting) added duplicatively. This construction goes against Irish linguistic usage as the word 'cumha' (lament) should be followed by the name in the genitive case of the person the lament was made for (i.e., the baron of Loughmore) and not the composer (i.e., an tAlbanach, Scott) as per English; the composer should be indicated by the word 'le' (by), as per the phrase 'leis an Albanach' (by Scott).
