The double-wing is an offensive formation in American football which should not be confused with the Double Wing offense. The double-wing formation is used in many offenses from the youth level through college. The formation was first introduced by Glenn "Pop" Warner around 1912. Just a few offenses that use the formation are the double wing, flexbone and wing T offenses. It was the primary formation used by Ara Parseghian when he ran the wing T at Notre Dame, winning National Championships in 1966 and 1973.

The formation is not necessarily the same in all offenses and is often a broad term to describe any offense with two wingbacks. In the wing T the double wing formation is used to refer to Red, Blue and Loose Red formations.

The Double wing formation in American Football usually includes one wide receiver, two wingbacks, one Fullback, and one tight end.
