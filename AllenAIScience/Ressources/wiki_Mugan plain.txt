== Alikemek-Tepesi ==
The ancient settlement of Alikemek-Tepesi (Alikemektepesi), dating to c. 5000 BC, is located in Mugan plain, and covers an area of over 1 hectare. Early levels belonged to Shulaveri-Shomu culture.
Materials from this site are very close to the materials obtained from monuments of northwestern Iran (Dalma ware). The artifacts of the lower level are similar to those at Kültəpə I in Nakhchivan. In the upper levels, there is also pottery of the northern Ubaid period type.
Some archaeologists speak of the ancient Alikemek-Kul'tepe culture of southeastern Caucasus, that followed the Shulaveri-Shomu culture, and covered the transition from the Neolithic to Chalcolithic periods (c. 4500 BC).
