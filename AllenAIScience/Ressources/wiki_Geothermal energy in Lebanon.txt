Geothermal energy in Lebanon is a branch of the energy industry, expanding quickly over the last several years. According to a UNDP assessment (CEDRO project), the geothermal energy available in Lebanon is 1,000 million megawatt hours (70 000 fold the amount of energy needed in Lebanon per year). The study includes a geothermal atlas for the country and estimates the current overall potential of geothermal heat and power generation.


== Geothermal power ==
Lebanese energy and water ministry intend to meet 0.2 percent of Lebanonâ€™s total power energy needs with geothermal sources by 2025. 


== Geothermal for cooling and heating ==


=== Implementation ===
Lebanese private sector and UNDP are beginning to design and install high performance ground source heating pump aiming to provide heating, cooling and hot water demand from the ground heat sink.  These implementations allow the beneficiaries to save big amount of energy on cooling and heating. 


=== Quality and cost efficiency ===
Geothermal heat pumps use much less energy than conventional heating systems and have the best indoor air quality. Units are very smooth, quiet in operation and very reliable comparable to a refrigerator since the units are not subjected to wear and tear caused by snow, rain and sun. Thus the Bank of Lebanon in cooperation with the IBL bank offer loans of 0% interest rate and up to 15 years repayment period. In addition, a grant is offered by the European Community.
