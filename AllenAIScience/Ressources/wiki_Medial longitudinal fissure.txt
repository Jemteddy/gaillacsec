The medial longitudinal fissure (or cerebral fissure, or longitudinal fissure, or interhemispheric fissure) is the deep groove that separates the two hemispheres of the vertebrate brain.
The falx cerebri, a dural brain covering, lies within the medial longitudinal fissure.
The corpus callosum crosses the medial longitudinal fissure.
