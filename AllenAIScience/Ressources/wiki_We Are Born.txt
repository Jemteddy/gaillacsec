We Are Born is the fifth studio album by Australian singer-songwriter Sia. It was released on 18 June 2010. The album is more upbeat than her previous work, which she partly attributes to her relationship with JD Samson as well as her childhood influences Cyndi Lauper and Madonna. The album was produced by Greg Kurstin and features guitar from The Strokes' guitarist Nick Valensi.
The album's first single, "You've Changed" was released in December 2009 and the second, "Clap Your Hands", in April 2010. We Are Born debuted at number 2 on the Australian Albums Chart and was Sia's first top 10 release in her home country. The album won Best Pop Release and Best Independent Release at the 2010 ARIA Music Awards. The album received Gold accreditation in the Australian ARIA charts in 2011.
