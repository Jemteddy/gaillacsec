A blastocoel, blastocoele or blastocele (also called blastocyst cavity, cleavage cavity or segmentation cavity) is the fluid-filled central region of a blastula and mammalian blastocyst. A blastocoel forms during embryogenesis when a zygote (a fertilized ovum) divides into many cells through mitosis.
The adjectival of "blastocoel" is blastocoelic.
A blastocoel can be described as the first cell cavity formed as the embryo enlarges. It is essential for later gastrulation.
