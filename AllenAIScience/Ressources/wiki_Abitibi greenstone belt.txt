The Abitibi greenstone belt is a 2,800-2,600 million year old greenstone belt that spans across the Ontario-Quebec border in Canada. It is mostly made of volcanic rocks, but also includes ultramafic rocks, mafic intrusions, granitoid rocks, and early and middle Precambrian sediments.


== Geographical extent ==
The Abitibi greenstone belt is one of the world's largest Archean greenstone belts. It appears to represent a series of thrusted subterranes that exhibit similar geological, geochemical, and isotopical signatures as those formed during the evolution of paired active-arc-back-arc systems. The huge 2,707-2,696 million year old Blake River Megacaldera Complex is within the belt.
