"Down Down" is a popular song by the English rock band, Status Quo.
Written by Francis Rossi and Bob Young and produced by Status Quo, "Down Down" was Status Quo's only number one single in the UK Singles Chart to date. "Down Down" spent a week at the top of the chart in January 1975. The single was first released on 29 November 1974 on the Vertigo label, paired with the B-side song "Nightride". Both songs came from the album On The Level which had yet to be released. The album version lasts 5 minutes and 24 seconds and the single version 3 minutes and 49 seconds.
Originally it was entitled "Get Down", but this was changed before release, possibly to avoid confusion with the Gilbert O'Sullivan song of the same name.
Towards the end of his life, DJ John Peel was known for playing "Down Down" as part of his eclectic DJ sets.
In 1986 co-writer Bob Young released a country music style version of "Down Down" on his solo album In Quo Country.
In July 2012, Status Quo reworked the lyrics to create a 3-minute promotional song for the Australian supermarket chain Coles. The chorus chants, "down, down, prices are down". This was released on television and YouTube, the most famous of which depicts a mince rally.
