Methyl isocyanide or isocyanomethane is an organic compound and a member of the isocyanide family. This colorless liquid is isomeric to methyl cyanide (acetonitrile), but its reactivity is very different. Methyl isocyanide is mainly used for making 5-membered heterocyclic rings. The C-N distance in methyl isocyanides is very short, 1.158 Ã… as is characteristic of isocyanides. 


== Preparation and uses ==
Methyl isocyanide was first prepared Gautier by reaction of silver cyanide with methyl iodide. The common method for preparing methyl isocyanides is the dehydration of N-methylformamide.
Methyl isocyanide is useful for the preparation of diverse heterocycles. It is also a ligand in organometallic chemistry.
