First he lives for long time in Brussels and reports about the problems and developments of the EU. In his view are the real problems of the people, the social segregation and the democratic development. Especially the actual economic crisis and the social consequences he brings on the floor. Second he is an activist of the Italian antifascist organization ANPI as an international representative at the European Parliament and for all Italian in Belgium."
He is one of the authors of the book Lettere dall’Europa  and frequently writes for the Italian Magazine Patria Indipendente 
Filippo Giuffrida is the great-nephew of the Italian writer and journalist Leonida Rèpaci. President of the Belgian branch of ANPI he was elected at the Executive Committee of the International Federation of Resistance Fighters – Association of Anti-Fascists.
