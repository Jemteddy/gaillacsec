The welterweight division in mixed martial arts refers to a number of different weight classes:
The UFC's welterweight division, which groups competitors within 156 to 170 lb (71 to 77 kg)
Pancrase's welterweight division, which formerly limited competitors to 165 lb (75 kg) now revised to 170 lb (77 kg)
Shooto's welterweight class, which refers to competitors between 144 and 154 lb (66 and 70 kg)
Pride FC's (defunct) welterweight division, which limited competitors to 183 lb (83 kg)
SRC's (defunct) welterweight division, which formerly limited competitors to 168 lb (76 kg) revised to 170 lb (77 kg)
Dream's (defunct) welterweight division, which limited competitors to 168 lb (76 kg)


== Ambiguity and clarificationEdit ==
Many other sports that use the welterweight class, such as boxing, kickboxing, and Muay Thai, define it as below about 147 lbs. The MMA welterweight class is therefore significantly heavier than the welterweight class of these other sports. For the sake of uniformity, many American mixed martial arts websites refer to competitors between 156 and 170 lb (71 and 77 kg) as welterweights. This encompasses the Shooto middleweight division (167 lb / 76 kg).
The welterweight limit, as defined by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and the Association of Boxing Commissions is 170 lb (77 kg).
