A subspecialty is a narrow field within a specialty such as forensic pathology, which is a subspecialty of anatomical pathology. A subspecialist is a specialist of a subspecialty.
In medicine, subspecialization is particularly common in internal medicine, cardiology, and neurology, and has grown as medicine has:
become more complex, and
it has become clear that a physician's case volume is negatively associated with their complication rate; that is, complications tend to decrease as the volume of cases per physician goes up.
