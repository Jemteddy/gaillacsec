The fifth song on this album, "Poetenclub" is a homage to the Austrian popstar Falco who died two years before. In the song Nina Hagen sings over samples from interviews with Falco, thus creating a post-mortem duet.
"Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" and "Yes Sir" were previously sung by Zarah Leander. Nina Hagen also covered Zarah Leander's "Ich weiß es wird einmal ein Wunder geschehen" on the album Angstlos.
"Return of the Mother" is sung in English, "He Shiva Shankara" in Sanskrit, "Handgrenade" is an English version (with a different backing track) of "Höllenzug".
