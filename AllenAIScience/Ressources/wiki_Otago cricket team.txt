The Otago cricket team (nicknamed the Volts since the 1997-98 season) are a New Zealand first class cricket team formed in 1876 representing the Otago, Southland and North Otago regions. Their main governing board is the Otago Cricket Association which is one of six major associations that make up New Zealand Cricket.
The team plays most of its home games at the University Oval in Dunedin, but occasionally plays games at the Events Centre in Queenstown, Queen's Park Ground in Invercargill and formerly Molyneux Park in Alexandra before the pitch became unplayable. The team mainly plays First-Class, List A and Twenty20 matches against other New Zealand provincial sides, but also in the past has played touring sides.
Aaron Redmond is the Volts current First-Class and List A captain whilst Brendon McCullum and Ryan ten Doeschate captain the Twenty20 side. They replaced Craig Cumming who had captained the side since 2002. Vaughn Johnson replaced Mike Hesson as coach at the beginning of the 2011/12 season.

Players with international caps are listed in bold.


== GroundsEdit ==
Carisbrook and the University Oval have been used in Dunedin, with occasional matches in Invercargill (Queen's Park), and Oamaru (Whitestone Centennial Park). Many matches have been played at Molyneux Park in Alexandra in recent decades, particularly during the Christmas-New Year holiday season. The warm, dry summer climate of Central Otago can make for better cricketing conditions than the wetter coastal areas. In recent years the Queenstown Events Centre has been developed as a venue.


== Twenty20 Champions LeagueEdit ==
A rapid expansion of Twenty20 cricket led to the creation of the Twenty20 Champions League. It is a competition between various teams from the domestic Twenty20 competitions of Australia, South Africa, Pakistan, India, England, Sri Lanka, West Indies and New Zealand.
In the 2008/09 domestic season of the State Twenty20, Otago came out as the champions, and so were eligible to compete in the inaugural Twenty20 Champions League. However, they lost both their opening games in the competition and so weren't able to progress further.
The Volts again qualified for the league in the 2013 season where they were much more successful entering the competition having won a string of Twenty20 matches which eventually ended at fifteen when they lost the Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur.
