Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass) is the first official compilation album by The Rolling Stones, released on 28 March 1966, on London Records in the US and on 4 November 1966, by Decca Records in the UK. The two releases featured different cover art and track listing. The front cover for the American release was used for the rear photo on the UK edition.
The album cover photo for the US edition was shot at Franklin Canyon Park in Los Angeles by Guy Webster, while the UK cover photo was taken in New York City by Jerry Schatzberg.


== History ==
Reaching No. 3 on the US charts, where it remained for two years, Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass) proved to be a big smash and currently remains a popular Rolling Stones retrospective.
The UK Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass) includes tracks released after the American edition appeared. The Rolling Stones' debut 1963 single, a cover of Chuck Berry's "Come On", was included, but its more successful follow-up, "I Wanna Be Your Man" — composed by rivals (although in reality as friends) Lennon–McCartney — was left off the album.
Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass) reached no. 4 in the UK charts.
In August 2002, this US edition of Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass) was reissued in a new remastered CD and SACD digipak by ABKCO Records.
The re-release contains stereo mixes of "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", "Time Is on My Side", "It's All Over Now", and "Heart of Stone".
The British version was again made available to the public as part of a limited edition vinyl box set, titled "The Rolling Stones 1964–1969", in November 2010. It was also re-released digitally at the same time.
The vinyl version of the album includes a booklet inside the gatefold with pictures of The Rolling Stones in concert and in the studio.
It was released once more in 2011 by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese only SHM-SACD version.
