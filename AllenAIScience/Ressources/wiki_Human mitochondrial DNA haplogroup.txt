In human genetics, a human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup is a haplogroup defined by differences in human mitochondrial DNA. Haplogroups are used to represent the major branch points on the mitochondrial phylogenetic tree. Understanding the evolutionary path of the female lineage has helped population geneticists trace the matrilineal inheritance of modern humans back to human origins in Africa and the subsequent spread around the globe.
The letter names of the haplogroups (not just mitochondrial DNA haplogroups) run from A to Z. As haplogroups were named in the order of their discovery, they (meaning the accidental dictionary ordering of the letters) do not reflect the actual genetic relationships.
The hypothetical woman at the root of all these groups (meaning just the mitochondrial DNA haplogroups) is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for all currently living humans. She is commonly called Mitochondrial Eve.

=== European haplogroups ===
Bryan Sykes had claimed there were seven major mitochondrial lineages for modern Europeans but others now put the number at 10-12. These additional "daughters" generally include haplogroups I, M and W. A recent paper re-mapped European haplogroups as H, J, K, N1, T, U4, U5, V, X and W. It should however be noted that haplogroups are arbitrary categories defined by mutations, which themselves are numerous and the result of a random process. It could reasonably be said that there are almost any number of haplogroups present in a particular region. Furthermore, attributing a specific geographic origin to any haplogroup, such as those proposed in the table below, is highly speculative and considered by most population geneticists to be 'story telling' and outside the domain of science. The same can also be said of inferring a close association between a specific haplogroup and a particular archaeological culture.
