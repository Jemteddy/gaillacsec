The conducting zone of the respiratory system is made up of the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and terminal bronchioles; their function is to filter, warm, and moisten air and conduct it into the lungs. It consists of a series of interconnecting cavities and tubes both outside and within the lungs. It is composed of the 1st through the 16th division of the respiratory tract (airway).
The conducting zone is thus most of the respiratory tract (airway); it is the portion of the airway that conducts gases, but excludes the portion that exchanges gases (which is the respiratory zone). Thus,
conducting zone + respiratory zone = respiratory tract (airway)
