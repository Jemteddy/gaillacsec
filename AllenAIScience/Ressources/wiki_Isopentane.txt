Isopentane, C5H12, also called methylbutane or 2-methylbutane, is a branched-chain alkane with five carbon atoms . Isopentane is an extremely volatile and extremely flammable liquid at room temperature and pressure. The normal boiling point is just a few degrees above room temperature and isopentane will readily boil and evaporate away on a warm day. Isopentane is commonly used in conjunction with liquid nitrogen to achieve a liquid bath temperature of −160 °C. It is 1% or less of natural gas.


== Nomenclature ==
2-methylbutane is the name recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). An isopentyl group is a subset of the generic pentyl group. It has the chemical structure -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2.


== Isomers ==
Isopentane is one of three structural isomers with the molecular formula C5H12, the others being pentane (n-pentane) and neopentane (dimethyl propane).


== Uses ==
Isopentane is used in a closed loop in geothermal power production to drive turbines.
Isopentane is used, in conjunction with dry ice or liquid nitrogen, to freeze tissues for cryosectioning in histology.
