Lehighton (pronounced Lee-HIGH-ton) is a borough in Carbon County, Pennsylvania, United States, 77 miles (124 km) north-northwest of Philadelphia. In the past, it developed early industries because of water power from the Lehigh River. With the location of a repair facility here and its regional operations, the Lehigh Valley Railroad became for years a major employer of thousands of people from the area. Post-World War II railroad and industry restructuring led to job and population losses.
From a peak of nearly 7,000 in 1940, the population was 5,500 at the 2010 census. Lehighton is the most populous borough in Carbon County and still the business hub of the county.


== History ==
At the time of European encounter with historic American Indian tribes, this area was part of the territory of the Lenape, also called Delaware, after their language and territory on the Delaware River. Their bands occupied much of the coastal mid-Atlantic area in Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York.
Lehighton was built on the site of the German Moravian Brethren's mission station "Gnadenhütten" (cabins of grace) founded in 1746. It was established as a mission to the Lenape by Moravians from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, lower on the Lehigh River. The German name was transcribed as "Canatanheat" by missionary John Brainerd.
During the French and Indian Wars (Seven Years' War), Native allies of the French killed 11 missionaries and Lenape (Delaware) converted Christians at Gnadenhutten on 24 November 1755. They destroyed the mission village, and only four of the fifteen residents escaped. (During the American Revolutionary War, in 1782 Pennsylvania militia raided another Moravian mission village, also called Gnadenhutten, in present-day Ohio. Suspecting the Lenape of being allied with the British, the militia killed 96 unarmed men, women, and children in what became better known as the Gnadenhutten Massacre.)
The Lehigh River was a source of water power for developing industries in the 19th century. Lehighton had silk and lace mills, a meat-packing house, shirt factory, automatic-press works, car shops, stoneworks, and foundries. In 1900, the population was 4,629 people. By 1940, it had reached 6,615.
The coming of the railroad made it easier for businessmen to get their products to major markets. For many years, the Lehigh Valley Railroad had a major repair facility in Lehighton. The coming of the railroad was a major economic boost for the town. It was the area's largest company, employing several thousand workers at the repair facilities or operating and maintaining the railroad. Restructuring in the railroad industry led to the repair facilities being moved to another location. Lost jobs meant that some people had to relocate for work.
The Lehighton downtown declined after the Carbon Plaza Mall was built in nearby Mahoning Township. Suburban housing developed, pulling more businesses from downtown. After struggling for three decades, the downtown is experiencing a rebirth as people appreciate the qualities of a compact central location and historic architecture.
The town holds an annual civic event, "Bike Night", featuring more than 28,000 motorcyclists.
In late September through October, the Country Junction store sponsors "The Great Pocono Pumpkin Festival". It features hayrides, walks in haunted woods, and cornfield mazes.
The town is on a north-south bird migration pattern, and birds can be frequently seen flying south in mass in the fall. One particularly tall grey rooftop overlooking the Lehigh River on the Rt. 209 bridge is a frequent stop for migrating birds.
