Tommy Boy Entertainment (formerly known as Tommy Boy Records) is an American independent record label started in 1981 by Tom Silverman. After parting ways with Warner Bros. Records in 2002, the label licensed its trademark to WEA for use on its reissues to date, now controlled by Warner Music, through Rhino/Atlantic Records and created Tommy Boy Films LLC with Michael "Mic" Neumann.
