Mr. Brown Coffee (Chinese: 伯朗咖啡; pinyin: Bólǎng Kāfēi) is a series of canned coffee products produced by King Car Group of Taiwan. It was launched in 1982. Mr. Brown Coffee is sold in 240ml steel cans and 330ml plastic bottles. Varieties include original, espresso, cappuccino, vanilla, Colombian, Macadamia nut, and Blue Mountain Style.
In 2008, it was discovered that because contaminated milk from a Chinese milk company was being used for Mr. Brown instant coffee mixes, the mix, too, was contaminated with melamine. Since then, Mr. Brown coffee mixes have switched its milk source to milk from New Zealand and the coffee mixes are now back on the market.
