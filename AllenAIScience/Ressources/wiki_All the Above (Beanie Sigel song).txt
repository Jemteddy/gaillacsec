"All the Above" is the first single from Beanie Sigel's fourth studio album, The Solution.


== Background ==
The track features R. Kelly and was produced by The Runners. It samples a line off from Jay-Z's skit "Public Service Announcement (Interlude)" from his album The Black Album.
Beanie Sigel spoke on the single, he said:

I ain't even know if he was gonna do it...I told him I got this record â€” 'cause you know the situation with Jay and him. ... I was like, 'If dude gets on this record, it'll be crazy.' So I sent it out to him, got the response he was gonna do it. [Kelly] knocked it out, he sent it back in like three days.


== Music video ==
The music video is directed by Jessy Terrero.
