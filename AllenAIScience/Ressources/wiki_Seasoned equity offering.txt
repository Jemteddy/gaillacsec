A seasoned equity offering or secondary equity offering (SEO) or Capital increase is a new equity issue by an already publicly traded company. Secondary offerings may involve shares sold by existing shareholders (non-dilutive), new shares (dilutive) or both. If the seasoned equity offering is made by an issuer that meets certain regulatory criteria, it may be a shelf offering.
