Staats Island is one of the Beaver Island Group in the Falkland Islands. It lies between Beaver Island and Weddell Island, parallel to Tea Island and is 500 hectares (1,200 acres) in area. It is known for its Patagonian foxes and guanacos, both introduced species; the former is not to be confused with the closely related Falkland Islands Fox now extinct. The introduction of Guanaco has led to overgrazing of the tussac while the introduction of foxes has had a negative effect on the resident birds and there is an eradication programme to eliminate foxes from this and other islands in the Beaver Island Group Other wildlife on the uninhabited island includes Magellanic penguins and other sea birds.
