Bonne Bouche is an aged goat's milk cheese made by Vermont Creamery, of Websterville, Vermont, since 2001. "Bonne bouche" is French for "tasty bite".
Made with fresh pasteurized goats’ milk from Vermont and Canadian farms, the curd is hand ladled, sprinkled with poplar ash, and aged to develop a rind. This cheese develops a wrinkled, geotrichum-rind also known as a "geo" rind. After aging for ten days at the creamery, the cheeses are packaged and sent to market where they will continue to age up to eighty days. As a young cheese, the rind has a pleasant yeast flavor and creamy interior becoming softer and more piquant with time.
