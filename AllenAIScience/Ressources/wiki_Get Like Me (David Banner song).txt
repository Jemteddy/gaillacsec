"Get Like Me" is the second single from David Banner's sixth album, The Greatest Story Ever Told. The song features Chris Brown and samples several lines from "It's Goin' Down" by fellow rapper Yung Joc, who, while not officially credited or featured, appears in the song's music video. There was an alternate version of the song featuring Jim Jones, but label troubles prevented his version from being released.


== Reception ==
Allmusic editor David Jeffries highlighted the song. Robert Christgau also highlighted it. Sputink Music's Maximilan Harknes wrote a positive review: "Another song that stands out on the album is the big hit single Get Like Me in all of its spastic, mainstream goodness (except Chris Brown‘s verse) (...) David Banner’s production gives the “Ballin!“ feel (“Get Like Me”)." Andrew Graham called this song banger.


== Music video ==
The video was shot at Los Angeles and directed by Ulysses Terrero. Chris Brown guest-stars in the video, as does Yung Joc. Cameos include Barry Bonds, Gabrielle Union, and the Maloof family brothers Gavin and Joe. The music video was released May 13, 2008 on BET's 106 & Park, but was leaked a few days earlier. Banner is seen at two points in the video wearing a shirt saying "I miss Pimp C", a reference to the deceased southern rapper. He also goes on and says in the song, "I got Chad in my heart, and DJ Screw in my cup." Chad was Pimp C's first name.


== Remixes ==
Lil Wayne released a freestyle of "Get Like Me", titled "Stuntin" with Canadian rapper Drake, on his mixtape Dedication 3. The official remix features Jim Jones.


== Charts ==
The song first appeared on the Billboard Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles at number 110 but that version featured Jim Jones after two weeks on the chart, peaking at 93, it fell off so the official single without Jim Jones could chart. This single has proven to be David Banner's second most successful to date, hitting #16 on the Billboard Hot 100, after "Play", which hit #7.
