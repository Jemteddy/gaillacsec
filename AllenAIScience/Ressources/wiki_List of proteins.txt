Note that there exists a category for proteins that is more complete than this list.
A list of proteins (and protein complexes). This list aims to organize information on the protein universe.
All proteins can be found in the human proteome unless marked with a "%".
If a protein has an EC number, it should be on List of enzymes and not on this page, even if it fits into one of the categories below.
For more information about categorizing protein types, see List of types of proteins.
