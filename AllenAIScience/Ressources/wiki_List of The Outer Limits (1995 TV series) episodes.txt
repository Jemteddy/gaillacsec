s. 1 ep. 3 "Valerie 23"
s. 2 ep. 2 "Resurrection"
s. 4 ep. 15 "Mary 25"
s. 4 ep. 26 "In Our Own Image"
note that "In Our Own Image" includes footage from s. 3 ep. 1 "Bits of Love", as well as footage from s. 3 ep. 7 "The Camp". Since the timelines do not match, this may or may not imply a link to the story arc of The New Masters/Tsal-Khan (from "The Camp"), and may or may not place "Bits of Love" into the Innobotics story arc. While pre- and post- holocaust and rebuilding scenarios are possible, overt clarity has not been supplied in the storylines.
