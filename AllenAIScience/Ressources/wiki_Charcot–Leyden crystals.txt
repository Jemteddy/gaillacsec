Charcot–Leyden crystals are microscopic crystals found in people who have allergic diseases such as asthma or parasitic infections such as parasitic pneumonia or ascariasis.
The Charcot-Leyden crystal protein interacts with eosinophil lysophospholipases.


== Appearance ==
They vary in size and may be as large as 50 µm in length. Charcot–Leyden crystals are slender and pointed at both ends, consisting of a pair of hexagonal pyramids joined at their bases. Normally colorless, they are stained purplish-red by trichrome. They consist of lysophospholipase(galectin 10), an enzyme synthesized by eosinophils, and are produced from the breakdown of these cells.


== Clinical significance ==
They are indicative of a disease involving eosinophilic inflammation or proliferation, such as is found in allergic reactions and parasitic infections.
Charcot–Leyden crystals are often seen pathologically in patients with bronchial asthma.


== History ==
Friedrich Albert von Zenker was the first to notice these crystals, doing so in 1851, after which they were described jointly by Jean-Martin Charcot and Charles-Philippe Robin in 1853, then in 1872 by Ernst Viktor von Leyden.
