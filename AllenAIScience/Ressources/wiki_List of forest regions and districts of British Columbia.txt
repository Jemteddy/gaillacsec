The Forest Regions and Forest Districts of British Columbia are a system of organization used by the Ministry of Forests of British Columbia for the administration of the province's forest lands. The names of the regions and districts as geographic locators in research papers and reports by academics and writers from outside or peripheral to the field of forestry such as botany, archaeology, wildlife science, fisheries, geography and recreation. Directors of Forest Regions and Forest Districts have sweeping powers, including control over and construction and maintenance of range roads and forest service roads and administration of cutting rights, fire control, silviculture, Forest Ministry campgrounds and other matters. District and regional offices have influence in regional planning and representation on various planning boards and similar institutions. Among these are the Integrated Resource Management Plans such as the Taku-Tlinkit Management Plan and the Lillooet Regional Management Plan boards and the regional planning authorities such as the Mainland Southwest Development Region. The Ministry of Forests has historically been under the authority of the British Columbia Minister of Forests, and has also historically been among the most important positions in the provincial cabinet. It was recently combined into a new ministry called the Ministry of Lands, Forests and Natural Resource Operations.
