Glass art refers to large, modern works of art, typically one-off creations, which are substantially or wholly made of glass. It is distinguished from "art glass" and "studio glass" which are typically smaller and often made in editions of many identical pieces, but the boundaries are not clear cut. Glass art is more likely to be exhibited in public spaces rather than in homes.


== Glass sculptureEdit ==

Statuesque or monumental one-off glass sculptures, such as those by Livio Seguso and the partnership of Stanislav Libenský and Jaroslava Brychtová, come under "glass art". So too, one-off pieces whose design is so avant-garde that they become "art" first and the material glass, while integral to the construction or form, is a secondary consideration. A good example of this is René Roubícek's "Object" 1960, a blown and hot-worked piece of 52.2 cm (20.6 in) shown at the "Design in an Age of Adversity" exhibition at the Corning Museum of Glass in 2005. Smaller glass sculptures, produced in limited numbers, such as the Lampwork figures of Stanislav Brychta are examples of Art glass.


== Glass panelsEdit ==

Artistically decorated, individually commissioned, large glass panels are usually for interior use, often in hotels, cruise liners and restaurants or night clubs. The decorative techniques used, beside stained glass, would include wheel carving, engraving, frosting, acid-etching, enameling, and gilding (including Angel gilding), often combining techniques by the use of masking or silkscreening.


== Knitted glassEdit ==

Knitted Glass is a technique developed in 2006 by artist Carol Milne. Knitted glass incorporates the techniques of knitting, lost-wax casting, mold-making, and kiln-casting.


== Glass fashionEdit ==
Haute Glass Couture refers to the creation of exclusive custom-fitted clothing made from sculpted glass. Haute Glass Couture is made to order for a specific customer, and it is usually made entirely of glass with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable glass artists, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques.


== Mixed-media innovationEdit ==
Contemporary Chinese artists Ms. Zhengcui Guo and Dr. Peng Yi premiered a new hybrid mixed media of glass art and felting - "glelting" - with positive critical reviews at the 2015 Ha You Arts Festival.
