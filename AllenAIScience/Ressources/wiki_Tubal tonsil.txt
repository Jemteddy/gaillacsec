The tubal tonsil is one of the four main tonsil groups comprising Waldeyer's tonsillar ring, which also includes the palatine tonsils, the lingual tonsils, and the pharyngeal tonsils.
The tubal tonsil is very close to the torus tubarius, which is why this tonsil is sometimes also called the tonsil of (the) torus tubarius. Equating the torus with its tonsil however might be seen as incorrect or imprecise.
It is located posterior to the opening of the Eustachian tube into the nasopharynx.
