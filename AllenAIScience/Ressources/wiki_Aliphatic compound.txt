In organic chemistry, compounds composed of carbon and hydrogen are divided into two classes: aromatic compounds and aliphatic compounds (/ˌælɨˈfætɨk/; G. aleiphar, fat, oil) also known as non-aromatic compounds. Aromatic compounds contain an aromatic-ring configuration of atoms, such as benzene, whereas aliphatic compounds do not. Aliphatic compounds can be saturated, like hexane, or unsaturated, like hexene.


== StructureEdit ==
Aliphatic compounds can be saturated, joined by single bonds (alkanes), or unsaturated, with double bonds (alkenes) or triple bonds (alkynes). Besides hydrogen, other elements can be bound to the carbon chain, the most common being oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, and chlorine.
The simplest aliphatic compound is methane (CH4). Aliphatics include alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes.


== PropertiesEdit ==
Most aliphatic compounds are flammable, allowing the use of hydrocarbons as fuel, such as methane in Bunsen burners and as liquified natural gas (LNG), and acetylene in welding.


== Examples of aliphatic compounds / non-aromaticEdit ==
The most important aliphatic compounds are:
n-, iso- and cyclo-alkanes (saturated hydrocarbons)
n-, iso- and cyclo-alkenes and -alkynes (unsaturated hydrocarbons).
Important examples of low-molecular aliphatic compounds can be found in the list below (sorted by the number of carbon-atoms):
A few structures can be shown as example:
But-1-ene can be shown as
CH2=CH-CH2-CH3


== Aliphatic acidsEdit ==
Aliphatic acids are the acids of nonaromatic hydrocarbons, such as acetic, propionic, and butyric acids.
