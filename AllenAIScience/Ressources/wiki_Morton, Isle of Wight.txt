Morton is the area of Brading to the south where Morton Marshes and the River Yar separate Brading from the extension of housing estates from the larger town of Sandown. It is distinguished by the hawthorn hedges which bloom with white flowers and are said to signify an unseasonal cold spell, termed a "Blackthorn Winter" in local weather lore.
