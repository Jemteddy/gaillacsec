Jacinto is a Spanish and Portuguese name meaning Hyacinth, which can refer to Saint Hyacinth, a Roman martyr (Hyacinth and Protus), or the Hyacinth flower itself.
A common English nickname for "Jacinto" is "Jack", however, it is only a translation of this name. Jacinto has only a few equivalents in other languages such as the Polish "Jacek" and "Jacenty", the Italian "Giacinto" and the Hungarian "JÃ¡cint".
