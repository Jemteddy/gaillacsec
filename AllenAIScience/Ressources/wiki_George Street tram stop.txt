George Street tram stop is a tram stop in Croydon. It is one of the busiest stops on the line as it is the most centrally located stop for the main shopping areas. It is almost directly outside the former Allders store and is on the site of the Park Place proposed development. Tramlink trams serve the stop, where trams depart in a westbound direction only.
