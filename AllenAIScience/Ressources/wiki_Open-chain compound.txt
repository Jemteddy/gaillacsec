In chemistry, an open-chain compound (also spelled as open chain compound) or acyclic compound (Greek prefix "α", without and "κύκλος", cycle) is a compound with a linear structure, rather than a cyclic one.  An open-chain compound having no side chains is called a straight-chain compound (also spelled as straight chain compound).
