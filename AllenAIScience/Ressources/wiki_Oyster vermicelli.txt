Oamisoir (traditional Chinese: 蚵仔麵線; Taiwanese: ô-á mī-sòaⁿ) is the English name for a kind of noodle soup popular in Taiwan. Its main ingredients are oysters and misua (Taiwanese vermicelli). One of the famous places serving this is in Dihua Street, Dadaocheng, Taipei. A tan-brown variety of vermicelli used for this dish is made primarily with wheat flour and salt, and gains its unique colour due to a steaming process which caramelizes the sugars in the dough allowing it to be cooked for longer periods without breaking down.
An alternative is vermicelli with large intestine, in which oysters are substituted with small segments of pig's large intestine.
