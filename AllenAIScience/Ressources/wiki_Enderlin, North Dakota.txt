Enderlin is a city in Cass and Ransom counties in the State of North Dakota. The population was 886 at the 2010 census.


== HistoryEdit ==
Enderlin was founded in 1891.
Local folklore suggests the name is derived from the semi-German "End der Line" ("end of the line"), as the city was briefly the terminus of the Soo Line Railroad's main line through North Dakota. Another explanation is that the name was suggested by the wife of a Soo Line official and comes from a fictional character in a book.
