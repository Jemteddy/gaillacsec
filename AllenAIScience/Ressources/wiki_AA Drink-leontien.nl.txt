AA Drink–leontien.nl was a cycling team based in the Netherlands. The title sponsors were AA Drink ('after activity drink'), a Dutch sports drinks brand owned by United Soft Drinks, and leontien.nl, a women's health and fitness website associated with former champion cyclist Leontien van Moorsel, whose husband Michael Zijlaard was the team manager.
In August 2012, Zijlaard informed the riders and staff that the team would disband at the end of the 2012 racing season, as AA Drink were not extending their sponsorship beyond 2012 and he and van Moorsel had decided not to seek a new sponsor.
