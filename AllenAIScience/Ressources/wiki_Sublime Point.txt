Sublime Point is a feature of the Illawarra Escarpment west of Austinmer. It is a summit on the plateau edge where the escarpment turns to go in a more northerly direction from a more northeasterly direction.
The summit has a cafe and lookout and is visited regularly. Sublime Point Lookout may be reached by road from the Princes Highway above Austinmer, or by a walking track from Austinmer and Thirroul.
The name also applies to several less well known geographical features in Australia, including one in the Blue Mountains, and several places across the world.
