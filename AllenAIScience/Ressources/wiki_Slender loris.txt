Slender lorises (Loris) are a genus of loris native to India and Sri Lanka. The slender loris spends most of its life in trees (arboreal), traveling along the top of branches with slow and precise movements. It is found in tropical rainforests, scrub forest, semi deciduous forest and swamps. The species have lifespans of 15 years and are nocturnal. Slender lorises generally feed on insects, reptiles, shoots of plants and fruits. Locally, they are referred to as Kaadu Paapa ("forest baby") in Kannada, Kutti thevangu' in Tamil, and Unahapuluwa in Sri Lanka.

According to biologists, poaching activity has led to the steady decline of the species in Tamil Nadu. Native people have always believed that all parts of the slender loris have some medicinal or magical powers. This has contributed greatly to the decline of the slender loris. In addition, slender lorises are illegally smuggled to supply a growing exotic pet trade. Along the western region of Tamil Nadu, there is a vigorous clampdown on illegal poaching of slender lorises.
Destruction of tropical rain forest habitat is also contributing to declines in population.
