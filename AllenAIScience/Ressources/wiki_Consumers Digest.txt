Founded in 1960 and published by Consumers Digest Communications, LLC, Consumers Digest (ISSN 0010-7182 is an American magazine.
The magazine has no subscribers and does not actually test the products they present their 'Best Buys' awards to. Instead, companies pay Consumers Digest for the right to promote their products as 'Best Buys'. They rely on consumer confusion of their name with the well-known Consumer Reports magazine, published by the nonprofit organization Consumers Union.


== History ==
The magazine is sold at newsstands only and does not reveal its sales figures. In 2001, when it ceased subscription distribution, it listed 700,000 subscribers (the list was sold to Time, Inc.). The publication has no connection with the Consumer Reports magazine or with Consumers Digest Weekly.
