Optochin (or ethylhydrocupreine) is a chemical used in cell culture techniques for the presumptive identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is optochin-sensitive, from other alpha-hemolytic streptococci such as Streptococcus viridans, which are resistant. A common mnemonic is "OVRPS" (Optochin - Viridans [are] Resistant, Pneumoniae [are] Sensitive). Or "VROPS" (Viridans Resistant [to] Optochin, Pneumoniae Sensitive)
The growth of bacteria that are optochin-sensitive will be inhibited around an optochin disc, while the growth of bacteria that are optochin-resistant will not be affected. In vitro, a solution of as little as 1:10,000,000 may be inhibitory to the pneumococcus, and 1:500,000 is bactericidal.


== Resistance ==
Strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae have been found to be resistant to optochin in laboratory testing.
