The Drips is a punk rock band from Los Angeles, currently signed to White Drugs/Wichita Recordings.


== History ==
A side-project of members of various other bands, The Drips are Matt Caughthran and Joby J. Ford, both from The Bronx, Tony Bevilaqua from The Distillers, David Hidalgo, Jr. from Suicidal Tendencies and Social Distortion and Vincent Hidalgo from Bullet Treatment and Mariachi el Bronx.
Due to the touring duties of the members' different bands, The Drips were extremely inactive for their first five years. Their first album, self-titled "The Drips," was released in April 2006 mid-way through a UK tour. The album received many favourable reviews, with critics hailing their sound as "muscular and melodic... a thrilling blur"[1].
