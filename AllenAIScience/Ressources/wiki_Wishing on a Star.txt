"Wishing on a Star" is a 1978 hit single by Rose Royce for Whitfield Records.
Included on their second album, Rose Royce II: In Full Bloom, "Wishing on a Star" is a slow ballad written by Billie Rae Calvin and produced by Norman Whitfield. The lyrics concern a woman longing for the return of an ex-lover so that they can resume their relationship. The original version of "Wishing on a Star" was not a big hit, peaking at number 52 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. However, the song was a big chart hit in the United Kingdom, reaching number three in March 1978. The parent album, In Full Bloom, was also successful as a whole. The single was re-released as the X Factor's charity single for 2011. The single features JLS and One Direction.
The song was rerecorded by Miriam Stockley and used as the theme tune to the US TV series "The 10th Kingdom" released in 2000.

== Seal version ==
In 2011, "Wishing on a Star" was covered by Nigerian-British soul singer Seal. It was released as the first UK single taken from his album Soul 2 on November 20, 2011. This interpretation of "Wishing on a Star" was produced by previous collaborator, Trevor Horn.
Seal's version of the song was premiered on Ken Bruce's BBC Radio 2 show on October 13, 2011. The single later peaked on the Radio 2 B-list.


=== Critical reception ===
In her review for Soul 2, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian expressed, "His voice and interpretive skills are such, though, that most tracks fit him like a glove, to the point where, on Rose Royce's Wishing on a Star, his oak-aged vocal seems a better fit for the remorseful lyric than original singer Gwen Dickey's. He grew up with these 1970s hits, and evidently reveres them, but isn't cowed by them". In his review, Mike Diver of the BBC expressed that "Seal has a voice that can melt icecaps has never been doubted by his detractors – the problems with his material post-Seal (II) went deeper, to a basic songwriting level. Here, freed of the weight of his own emotions, he soars on a sublime Wishing on a Star (which manages to borrow its smoky backing from Sade’s Smooth Operator).

Seal is due to perform "Wishing on a Star" on Daybreak on November 25, 2011.
