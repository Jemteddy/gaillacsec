Star Wars: The Clone Wars is an American 3D CGI animated television series created by Lucasfilm Animation, Lucasfilm Animation Singapore and CGCG Inc. On August 15, 2008 the Star Wars: The Clone Wars film was released in theaters; it served as the official pilot episode and the introduction of the series. The series made its debut on the American Cartoon Network on October 3, 2008. It is set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy, during the same time period as the previous 2003 Star Wars: Clone Wars series. The show itself takes place during the three-year interim between Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Each episode has a running time of 22 minutes, to fill a half-hour time slot. Star Wars creator George Lucas originally claimed that "there [would] be at least 100 episodes produced".
On March 11, 2013, Lucasfilm announced that Star Wars: The Clone Wars would be "winding down," effectively canceling the series. The unreleased episodes that had already been produced are referred to as "bonus content." On January 16, 2014, the German television network Super RTL announced their plans to air the "bonus content" as a sixth season, which would consist of 13 episodes. Season 6, along with the other seasons and the feature film, were made available on Netflix on March 7, 2014.
