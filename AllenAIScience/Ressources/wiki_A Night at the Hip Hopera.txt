A Night at the Hip Hopera is the third album by The Kleptones. It fused Queen's rock music with rap vocals and many sound bites from movies (such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off) and other sources. Unlike 1992's cancelled BASIC Queen Bootlegs album and despite its title, it is considered a bastard pop album rather than a hip-hop album.
On November 8, 2004, Waxy, the main site that hosted A Night At The Hip Hopera, received a cease & desist notice from the Walt Disney Company (Hollywood Records) for illegal sampling of songs by Queen, similar to the banning of DJ Danger Mouse's The Grey Album. However, the album is still widely available for download.

== Related track ==
"Bo Rhap" – 6:50
Although not part of the A Night At The Hip Hopera album, this unique track mashes up multiple versions of Queen's legendary song, Bohemian Rhapsody. It was released as a Christmas 2004 single (after the album), and since Bohemian Rhapsody was not among the songs sampled by the Kleptones for the album, it's possible that "Bo Rhap" was meant to be part of it, or at the very least a bonus track.

"Kill" & "Smash"
While neither are on the album, they are included on the unreleased tracks compilation Shits & Giggles.
