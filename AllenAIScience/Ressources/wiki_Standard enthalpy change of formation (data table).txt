These tables include heat of formation data gathered from a variety of sources, including the primary and secondary literature, as well as the NIST Chemistry WebBook. Note that the table for Alkanes contains Î”fH o values in kcal/mol (1 kcal/mol = 4.184 kJ/mol), and the table for Miscellaneous Compounds and Elements contains these values in kJ/mol.
