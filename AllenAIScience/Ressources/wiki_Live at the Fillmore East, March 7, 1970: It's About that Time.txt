Live at the Fillmore East March 7, 1970: It's About that Time is a live double album by Miles Davis. Sony Music Entertainment released the album in 2001, although the concert had previously circulated as a bootleg recording. The March 7, 1970 concert consisted of two sets, each of which is presented on one compact disc.
Live at the Fillmore East records the final concert with saxophonist Wayne Shorter in Davis' band. At the same time, it is one of the first recordings (along with the 1969 Miles Festiva De Juan Pins) to document Davis' use of electric instruments in a concert setting. Davis performed on the nights of March 6 and 7 at Fillmore East; Columbia Records recorded both nights' concerts, but as of 2008 has only released the March 7 show. (The March 6 shows are available through Wolfgang's Vault, however). A number of the compositions performed during the concert appear on Bitches Brew, which had not yet been released at the time of this concert.
These performances were as support to Neil Young and Crazy Horse. Young's performance has also been released as a live album.
