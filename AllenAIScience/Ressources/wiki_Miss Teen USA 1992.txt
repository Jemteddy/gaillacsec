Miss Teen USA 1992, the tenth Miss Teen USA pageant, was televised live from the Mississippi Gulf Coast Coliseum in Biloxi, Mississippi on 25 August 1992.
At the conclusion of the final competition, Jamie Solinger of Iowa was crowned by outgoing queen Janel Bishop of New Hampshire. Jamie is the first Miss Teen USA from Iowa.
The pageant was hosted by Dick Clark for the third of four years, with color commentary by Leeza Gibbons in her third and final year, and Miss Teen USA 1990 Bridgette Wilson, for the only time. Music was provided by the Gulf Coast Teen Orchestra for the third consecutive year.

This was the third of five years that the pageant was held in Biloxi, and it was interrupted by the effects of Hurricane Andrew which devastated Florida and the Gulf Coast over the period the pageant was held.
Prior to the pageant, evacuation plans were in place for the pageant to evacuate to Mobile, Alabama or Jackson, Mississippi if weather conditions deteriorated.
The final competition was forced to be held early because of the hurricane threat, and the contestants were then bussed further inland. This was the first time in the pageant's ten year history that the event was not broadcast live. During the pre-recorded competition the crownings of both Jamie Solinger and first runner-up Angela Logan were filmed in an attempt to keep the result secret until the eventual broadcast of the event. Angela was told one hour before the evening telecast that Solinger had won and that she was the first runner-up. The taping of two crownings became known as the "hurricane option" and would nearly be repeated at Miss Teen USA 1998 because of a live presidential address by Bill Clinton.
