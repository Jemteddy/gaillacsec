The Grammy Award for Best Music Film (until 2013 known as Best Long Form Music Video) is an accolade presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally named the Gramophone Awards, to performers, directors, and producers of quality videos or musical programs. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position".
The category was preceded by the Grammy Award for Video of the Year, which was presented in 1982 and 1983, awarding long form videos (or video albums as they were known back then) in the budding music video market. The category was discontinued after 1983.
The Best Music Film category is for concert/performance films or music documentaries. Music-related documentaries must have 51 percent or more music performance-based material. Also eligible are general release theatrical, non-fictional music-related films with 51 percent or more music performance-based material.
The Best Music Film category is one of two categories in the Best Music Video/Film Field. The other one is Best Music Video, which recognises stand-alone videos of one song or performance.


== History of the awardEdit ==
This category has undergone several name changes through the years:
Best Video Album (1984-1985)
Best Music Video, Long Form (1986-1997)
Best Long Form Music Video (1998-2013)
Best Music Film (2014-)
In 1988 and 1989, the award criteria were changed and the video accolades were presented under the categories Best Concept Music Video and Best Performance Music Video. The awards were returned to the original format in 1990. Except in 1988 and 1989, the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video recipients include the artists, directors, and producers associated with the winning videos.
Singers Madonna and Sting hold the record for the most wins as a performer in this category, with two each. To date, David Mallet is the only director to receive more than one Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video. He won his first award in 1992 and a second at the 1995 ceremony. The British pop rock group Eurythmics holds the record for the most nominations as a performer without a win, with three from 1985 to 1991.


== RecipientsEdit ==
In 1984 and 1985, only the artists were presented with an award. In 1986 the award went to the artist(s) and the video director(s). From 1987 onwards, the award was presented to the artist(s), video director(s) and video producer(s).
