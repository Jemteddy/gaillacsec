Village Bonded Societies are the largest classification of acephalous societies. They differ from lineage-bonded societies and land-bonded societies mainly in that they are large enough to support both secret societies and age sets.
With both of those institutions in place, a village-bonded society can make the transition to statehood, if the need arises.
