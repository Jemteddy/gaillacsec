A brochure is an informative paper document (often also used for advertising), that can be folded into a template, pamphlet or leaflet. Brochures are advertising pieces mainly used to introduce a company or organization and inform about products and/or services to a target audience.
Brochures are distributed by radio, handed out personally or placed in brochure racks. They may be considered as grey literature. They are usually present near tourist attractions.


== Varieties ==
Brochures are now available in electronic format and are called e-brochures. The most common types of single-sheet brochures are the bi-fold (a single sheet printed on both sides and folded into halves) and the tri-fold (the same, but folded into thirds). A bi-fold brochure results in four panels (two panels on each side), while a tri-fold results in six panels (three panels on each side).
Other brochure fold arrangements are possible: the accordion or "z-fold" method, the "c-fold" method, etc. Larger sheets, such as those with detailed maps or expansive photo spreads, are folded into four, five, or six panels. When two card fascia are affixed to the outer panels of the z-folded brochure, it is commonly known as a "z-card".
Booklet brochures are made of multiple sheets most often saddle-stitched, stapled on the creased edge, or perfect bound like a paperback book, and result in eight or more panels.


== Printing ==
Brochures are often printed using four-color process on thick, glossy paper to give an initial impression of quality. Businesses may print small quantities of brochures on a computer printer or on a digital printer, but offset printing turns out higher quantities for less cost.
Compared with a flyer, a brochure usually uses higher-quality paper, more color, and is folded.
