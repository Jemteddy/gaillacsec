Treble refers to tones whose frequency or range is at the higher end of human hearing. In music this corresponds to "high notes". The treble clef is often used to notate such notes. Examples of treble sounds are guitar tones, female voice (such as soprano), young male voice, etc. They have frequencies above 2 kHz. Treble sound is the counterpart to bass sound.
The term "treble" derives from the Latin triplum, used in 13th century motets to indicate the third and highest range.
The treble control is used in sound reproduction to change the volume of treble notes relative to those of the middle and bass frequency ranges.
