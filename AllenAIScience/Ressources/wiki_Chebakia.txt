The Chebakia is a pastry of Moroccan origin made of strips of dough rolled to resemble a rose, deep-fried until golden, then coated with a syrup made of honey and rosewater and sprinkled with sesame.
Similar pastries include the Cartellate and the Fazuelos, though the latter is constructed differently, and is thinner and less dense.
