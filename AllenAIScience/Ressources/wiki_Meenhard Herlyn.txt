Meenhard Herlyn, D.V.M., D.Sc., is a researcher who works as director of The Wistar Institute Melanoma Research in Philadelphia. His primary research focus is the underlying biology behind melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Over the course of his career, he has been responsible for the use of three-dimensional artificial skin cultures to study tumor and normal cells, a clearer understanding of stem cells and how they relate to cancer, and signaling pathways related to cancer. The Wistar Melanoma (WM) cell lines that Herlyn has used and helped discover in his laboratory are responsible for a better understanding of the major steps of tumor progression in human cases of melanoma.
In 2003, Herlyn helped launch the first International Melanoma Research Congress in Philadelphia, the first scientific meeting specifically aimed at melanoma scientists. This was done in collaboration with the Foundation for Melanoma Research. This collaboration was prompted with his first direct melanoma patient interaction after more than two decades of research on the disease. He also established the Society for Melanoma Research in 2004 and served as its president for three years.
One of the more recent discoveries made by Herlyn's lab found that the diabetes drug phenformin could be used to treat certain slow-growing, drug-resistant tumor cells in melanoma. In December 2013, it was announced that Herlyn and his colleagues had received a five-year, $12.5 million program project grant (PO1) to continue research on melanoma from multiple angles. In May 2013, L'Or√©al Paris announced that Herlyn would lead the Melanoma Research Alliance Team Science Award, which provides more than $750,000 over three years to research the prevention, treatment, and potential cures for melanoma.
