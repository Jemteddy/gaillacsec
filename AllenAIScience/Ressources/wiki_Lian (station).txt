Lian Station is the terminus of Gråkallbanen, the remaining part of the Trondheim Tramway in Trondheim, Norway. The station serves as the main access point to the cities largest recreational area Bymarka west of Byåsen.
The station was built for the third expansion of line and opened in 1933. Until 1947, the trams had to change direction at the station, but in that year a loop was built allowing the trams to continue back along the loop.
