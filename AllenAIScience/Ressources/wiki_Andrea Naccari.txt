Andrea Naccari (1841 – 1919) is notable for his study of the thermoelectric properties of metals, the photoelectric effect of metals immersed in liquids, and the electrical conductivity of gases and liquid dielectrics. He showed that the variation in the electrical resistance of distilled water was due largely to the solubility of the glass of the receptacle in which it was contained.
He obtained his PhD in pure maths in 1862 at the University of Padua under Francesco Rossetti.
