Solar power in Poland is a new sector of renewable power. While solar photovoltaics (PV) is in its infancy, non-electric solar thermal, used for heating water was widely used in about 1,200,000 square metres (13,000,000 sq ft) of solar thermal collector at the end of 2012. This corresponds to about 848 MWth capacity (an increase of 19% compared to 2011). Solar collectors are the second, after the biomass heating plants, source of "green heat" in Poland. In 2012, Poland was ranked second in sales of solar collector installations among European countries (in 2011 - fourth place).
According to the Polish Institute for Renewable Energy, the total installed photovoltaic capacity in Poland amounted to approximately 6.6 MWp at the end of September 2014.
