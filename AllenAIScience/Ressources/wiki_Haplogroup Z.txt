In human mitochondrial genetics, Haplogroup Z is a human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup.


== OriginEdit ==
Haplogroup Z is believed to have arisen in Central Asia, and is a descendant of haplogroup CZ.


== DistributionEdit ==
Its greatest clade diversity is found in Korea, northern China, and Central Asia. However, its greatest frequency appears in some peoples of Russia and among the Saami people of northern Scandinavia.


== SubcladesEdit ==


=== TreeEdit ===
This phylogenetic tree of haplogroup Z subclades is based on the paper by Mannis van Oven and Manfred Kayser Updated comprehensive phylogenetic tree of global human mitochondrial DNA variation and subsequent published research.
