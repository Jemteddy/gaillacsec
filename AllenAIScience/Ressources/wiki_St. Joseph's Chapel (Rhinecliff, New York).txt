== History ==
Prior to 1862, Catholics is the area near Rhinecliff attended services in Rondout. St.Joseph's was established in 1862 by Rev. Michael J. Skully to serve Irish Catholic families who settled in Rhinecliff to work on the railroad. Services were held at the Starr Institute. The parish included all the area between Poughkeepsie and Hudson, NY. and served as the mother church for the mission churches of Regina Coeli in Hyde Park, St. Paul's Staatsburgh, Sacred Heart Barrytown, and St Sylvia's in Tivoli.
Originally the intent was to build on the northwest corner of Livingston and Mulberry Streets in Rhinebeck, but the lot was sold when the residents of Rhinecliff objected. In 1863 George Rogers of Tivoli bought six acres in Rhincliff from Charles H. Russell and deeded them to Father Skully for a church and cemetery. The church, built in 1864,  was designed by local architect George Veitch, with John Bird as master mason.
In 1888 priests from St. Joseph's Rhinecliff also tended to a mission church, St. Joseph's in Clinton Corners, St Paul's in Staatsburg later became a mission church of Regina Coeli in Hyde Park, and remains so.
