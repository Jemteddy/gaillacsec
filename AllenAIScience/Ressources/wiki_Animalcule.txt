Animalcule ("little animal", from Latin animal + the diminutive suffix -culum) is an older term for a microscopic animal or protozoan. Some better-known animalcules include:
Actinophrys, and other heliozoa, called sun animalcules
Amoeba, called Proteus animalcule
Noctiluca scintillans, commonly called the 'Sea Sparkles'
Paramecium, called slipper animalcules
Rotifers, called wheel animalcules
Stentor, called trumpet animalcules
Vorticella, and other peritrichs, called bell animalcules
The term was also used by Anton van Leeuwenhoek, the 17th-century preformationist and discoverer of microorganisms, to describe spermatozoa.
The word appears in the Major-General's Song, in which Major-General Stanley sings, "I know the scientific names of beings animalculous..."
