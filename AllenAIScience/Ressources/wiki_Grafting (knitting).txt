In knitting, grafting is the joining of two knitted fabrics using yarn and a needle in one of three types of seams:
selvage-to-selvage seam,
selvage-to-end ("wales") seam, or
end-to-end ("wale-to-wale") seam.
The Kitchener stitch is a common method for the third type of seam. The yarn follows the route of a row of ordinary knitting. This is often done when closing off a knitted sock at the toe.
