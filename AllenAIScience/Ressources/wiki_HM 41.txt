HM 41 is an Iranian howitzer which is claimed to be based on the American M114. In appearance, it is very similar to the South Korean KH179. It has a 155 mm/39 calibre barrel with a muzzle brake to lessen the recoil. According to Iranian sources, the 155 mm/39 calibre HM41 weighs 6,890 kg and firing a rocket-assisted High-Explosive (HE) projectile, a maximum range of 30,000 m can be achieved. Firing an unassisted HE projectile, a maximum range of 22,000 m can be obtained. This is an improvement as compared to the M114. The Howitzer has been offered for export. But no country is known to be using it except Iran.
A wheeled self-propelled version is reported to be under development. The first prototype was finished in 2011.
In 2012, Iran unveiled laser guided Basir 155 mm artillery shells which were tested by an HM 41 howitzer.
