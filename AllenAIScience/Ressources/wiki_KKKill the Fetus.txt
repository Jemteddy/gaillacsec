KKKill the Fetus is the third studio album by Esham. Released in 1993, the album's lyrics focus on subjects such as abortion and murder. The album, which has been cited as an iconic horrorcore album, has been praised for its genre-defining production and lyrics. The single "Sunshine" received very heavy radio play nationally. The music video for "HeltersKKKelter" was featured on an episode of Yo! MTV Raps in 1994.
Esham announced a remastered version of the album will be available exclusively on the Acid Rap online store.


== Lyrics and music ==
The album's title track encourages drug-addicted women to have an abortion rather than to allow their children to be raised by unfit mothers. Many of the songs are short and heavily sample-based.


== Reception ==
In his review of the album, Jason Birchmeier wrote that "At this point in his career, his rapping has already reached near-peak levels, and his production shows a continued path towards an inventiveness. [...] Never again would Esham be so gritty."
In 2009, Fangoria named it as an iconic horrorcore album.
