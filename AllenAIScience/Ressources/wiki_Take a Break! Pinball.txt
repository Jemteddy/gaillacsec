Take a Break! Pinball was a 1993 pinball computer game collection by Dynamix/Sierra On-Line. It contained several individual boards based on various Dynamix or Sierra series such as King's Quest, Space Quest, The Adventures of Willy Beamish, Leisure Suit Larry, and Nova 9: Return of Gir Draxon. It is the second game in the Take a Break! series of casual Windows games. It was designed for Windows 3.x.


== Boards ==


=== Quest for Daventry ===
This board is based on King's Quest V. The game follows the narrative of the adventure game with objectives based on locations and encounters from that game. As objectives are completed on the board, new locations are opened up on the map. On this board, there was a bug that made the ball invisible after entering the Endless Desert Temple Stone Wall Trap. This was later patched with an updated DLL file.


=== Planet Pinball ===
Three boards based on Space Quest IV.


==== Level One: Planet Xenon in the Beginning ====


==== Level Two: Spaced Travel ====


==== Level Three: Reformation Day ====


=== Larry's Big Score ===
This board is based on Larry 5. It was later released as a stand-alone game in the early Leisure Suit Larry collections.


=== Flipped Out Willy ===
This board is based on the The Adventures of Willy Beamish.


=== Draxon ===
Two boards based on Nova 9.


==== Level One: Nova 9 ====


==== Level Two: Lots in Space ====


== Reception ==
Interactive Entertainment CD ROM Magazine criticized the colorful graphics on the some boards, saying that they made it "nearly impossible to keep your eye on the ball". They said that "taken as a serious pinball simulation, it falls short in more than one area".
