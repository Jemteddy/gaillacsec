John Mulholland (9 June 1898 in Chicago, Illinois – 25 February 1970 in New York City) was an American magician, author, publisher and intelligence agent.


== Life and workEdit ==
Mulholland learned the art of magic as a teenager with John William Sargent, President of the Society of American Magicians. Mulholland was a professional magician for two decades, working in small companies and large stage shows. He ran one of the first magic workshops and was from 1930 the editor of the magical trade magazine The Sphinx. He published many books on magic and its history.
During the Second World War, he wrote a spellbook for soldiers. His impressive collection is now owned by David Copperfield. He left The Sphinx in 1953, officially due to health problems but actually to work for the CIA.
