== Critical reception ==
7 Television Commercials received mixed reviews from critics. Reviewer Ian Reed felt that "it could have been better". Reed also commented on the duration of the video, just over 30 minutes, only seven music videos.
Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone gave the re-release collection of videos 2 out of 4 stars, also mentioning the length of the release: "Why only seven? And no bonus material? You'd think that a band as wary of commercial exploitation as Radiohead wouldn't ask fans to shell out for so slight a souvenir."
