A fictional book is a non-existent book created specifically for (i.e. within) a work of fiction. This is not a list of works of fiction (i.e., actual novels, mysteries, etc.), but rather imaginary books that do not actually exist.


== Uses ==
Such a book may (1) provide the basis of the novel's plot, (2) add verisimilitude by supplying plausible background, or (3) act as a common thread in a series of books or the works of a particular writer or canon of work. A fictional book may also (4) be used as a conceit to illustrate a story within a story, or (5) be essentially a joke title, thus helping to establish the humorous or satirical tone of the work. (Fictional books used as hoaxes or as purported support for actual research are usually referred to as false documents.)


=== Examples ===
Several stories in Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges' short story collection Ficciones are reviews of fictional books; in this case, the fictional book is the basis of the story. As an example of the second use of fictional books, Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell includes scholarly footnotes to invented biographies, magical texts and journals to add to the texture and depth of the story. H. P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon might be considered an example of the third usage, since it appears as a recurring motif in several of the Cthulhu Mythos stories. Many (but not all) of the fictional books mentioned in the work of Douglas Adams are of the joke title variety. H. G. Wells' "The Shape of Things to Come", which purports to be a history textbook published in 2106, includes - just like actual history books - numerous footnotes, some of them referring to actual historical sources but most to fictional ones.
Some books started out as fictional and were then written. Examples include Fly Fishing by the fictitious J.R. Hartley, from an advertisement; I, Libertine, a hoax by Jean Shepherd; and Venus on the Half-Shell by the fictitious Kilgore Trout, originally invented by Kurt Vonnegut, then written and published (attributed to Trout) by Philip José Farmer.


=== Inclusion criteria ===
This is a list of fictional books that appear in literature. Fictional books appearing in other print media, such as comics, are listed in List of fictional books from periodicals. Fictional books that appear in other types of media, such as television shows, are listed in List of fictional books from non-print media.
This is not a list of works of fiction (i.e., actual novels, mysteries, etc.), but rather imaginary books that do not actually exist. The fictional books on this list are ordered alphabetically under the name of the actual author who invented them.
