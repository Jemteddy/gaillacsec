The United States District Court for the District of North Dakota (in case citations, D.N.D.) is the United States District Court or the Federal district court, whose jurisdiction is the state of North Dakota. The court is headquartered out of Bismarck and has additional locations at Fargo, Grand Forks, and Minot. The district was created in 1889, when the Dakota Territory was divided into North Dakota and South Dakota. The Grand Forks courts are located at the Ronald N. Davies Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse.
In 1921, a second temporary judgeship was authorised, however, this was never made permanent and the judgeship expired in 1928. In 1954, a second permanent judgeship was authorised, and the strength of the court has remained unchanged since.
The United States Attorney's Office for the District of North Dakota represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. Christopher C. Myers is the United States Attorney for the District of North Dakota. Appeals from the Court are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).
