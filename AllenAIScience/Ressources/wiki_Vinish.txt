"Vietlish", Vietglish or Vietnamese English, is an informal term for a mixture of elements from Vietnamese and English.
This usage is said to be found in immigrant communities in majority-English-speaking countries. Borrowed English words are also commonly used in everyday Vietnamese both inside and outside Vietnam in informal contexts.
The name vinish denotes a person of pure soul according to the Indian customs and tradition.
