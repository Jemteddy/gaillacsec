Dishwashing liquid (BrE: washing-up liquid), known as dishwashing soap and dish soap, is a detergent used to assist in dishwashing. It is usually a highly-foaming mixture of surfactants with low skin irritation, and is primarily used for hand washing of glasses, plates, cutlery, and cooking utensils in a sink or bowl. In addition to its primary use, dishwashing liquid also has various informal applications, such as for creating bubbles, clothes washing and cleaning oil-affected birds.


== History ==

Washing soda (sodium carbonate) is used for dishwashing, and may be used in areas with hard water. It was used for dishwashing before detergents were invented in Germany during World War I. Liquid detergent used for dishwashing was first manufactured in the middle of the 20th century. Dishwashing detergent producers started production in the United States in the 1930–1940s. Teepol, the first such in Europe, commenced production in 1941.
In 2005, dishwashing detergent retail sales totaled nearly USD $10 billion worldwide.


== Types ==
Dishwashing detergents for dishwashers are manufactured and marketed variously as cartridges, gel, liquids, pacs, powder, and tablets. Any dishwashing liquid may contain bleach, enzymes, or rinsing aids. Some dishwashing detergents may be homemade, using ingredients such as borax, essential oil, eucalyptus oil and grated bar soap, among others.


=== Common ingredients ===
The main ingredient is water, whilst the main active ingredients are detergents. There are other thickening and stabilizing agents. Other ingredients may include surfactants, hydrotrope, salts, preservatives, fragrances, and dyes.
Surfactants remove grease and stuck food particles. They may also provide foam.
Some dishwashing detergents may contain phosphorus, an ingredient which at least two states within the United States have limited use in dishwashing detergent. According to the Washington Post, phosphorus keeps "minerals from interfering with the cleaning process and prevent food particles from depositing again on dishes." According to Time magazine, "One reason detergent makers have been using large amounts of phosphorus is that it binds with dirt and keeps it suspended in water, allowing the other cleaning agents to do their best work. Phosphorus is especially important in regions with hard water because the presence of lots of minerals can interfere with cleaning agents." Phosphorus that runs into freshwater lakes and rivers can cause algal blooms. Phosphate-free detergent reduces the amount of phosphate wastewater treatment plants must clean up. In the 21st century phosphates began to be reduced in percentage terms as an ingredient, leading to a New York Times report that said "low- or phosphate-free dishwasher detergents it tested, including those from environmentally friendly product lines that have been on the market for years, none matched the performance of products with phosphates".
In 2010, the United States FDA raised health concerns over triclosan, an antibacterial substance used in some dish liquids. Elsewhere, triclosan has been found to create problems at wastewater treatment plants, whereby it can "sabotage some sludge-processing microbes and promote drug resistance in others." The United States FDA has found that triclosan provides no health benefits over soap and water. As of 2014, at least one state within the United States has banned triclosan in dishwashing liquids.
Many dishwashing liquids contain perfume which can cause irritant or allergic contact dermatitis.

== Primary uses ==
Dishwashing liquid is used primarily for removing food from used dishes and tableware. Heavy soil (large food particles) is generally scraped from the dishes before using. Detergent formula can vary based on use (hand or automatic).


=== Hand dishwashing ===

Hand dishwashing is generally performed in the absence of a dishwashing machine, when large "hard-to-clean" items are present, or through preference. Some dishwashing liquids can harm household silver, fine glassware, anything with gold leaf, disposable plastics, and any objects made of brass, bronze, cast iron, pewter, tin, or wood, especially when combined with hot water and the action of a dishwasher. When dishwashing liquid is used on such objects it is intended that they be washed by hand.
Hand dishwashing detergents utilize surfactants to play the primary role in cleaning. The reduced surface tension of dishwashing water, and increasing solubility of modern surfactant mixtures, allows the water to run off the dishes in a dish rack very quickly. However, most people also rinse the dishes with pure water to make sure to get rid of any soap residue that could affect the taste of the food.
Dishwashing liquid can be a skin irritant and cause hand eczema. Those with "sensitive skin" are advised amongst other things to persuade someone else to do the washing up.


=== Automatic dishwashing ===
Automatic dishwashing involves the use of a dishwashing machine or other apparatus. It is generally chosen through convenience, sanitation, or personal preference. The cleaning is less reliant on the detergent's surfactants but more reliant on machine's hot water as well as the detergent's builders, bleach, and enzymes. Automatic dishwashing detergents' surfactants generally have less foam to avoid disrupting the machine.


== Informal uses ==
Reader's Digest notes its use as an ant killer, weed killer, to help spread water-borne fertilizer, and to wash human hair. Good Housekeeping says it can be used mixed with vinegar to attract and drown fruit flies. Dishwashing detergent has been used to clean mirrors as well as windows.


=== Bubbles ===
Dishwashing liquid can be mixed with water and additional ingredients such as glycerin and sugar to produce a bubble-blowing solution.


=== Clothes washing ===
Dishwashing liquid may be used for cleaning delicate clothing fabrics such as hosiery and lingerie.


=== Decal application ===
Dishwashing liquid is frequently recommended in a dilute solution to make decals and vinyl graphics easier to position when applying.


=== Leak detection ===
In industry, dishwashing liquid is also used to inspect pressurized equipment for leaks, such as propane fittings. It is used to inspect pneumatic tires for flats, as well as for quality assurance during the installation process, and as a mounting bead lubricant.


=== Mortar mix ===
It can be used to mix mortar when there is no plasticizer available on the building sites.


=== Pest deterrent ===
Dishwashing liquid has uses as an ingredient in making homemade garden pest deterrents. Oregon State University's Cooperative Extension Service notes the use of dishwashing liquid to get rid of spidermites. Dish soap has also been used to deter aphids. In some instances, the dish soap may be toxic to plant leaves and cause them to "burn". Use of soap or dish detergent to help spread pesticide on plants is noted by University of Georgia extension service, but not recommended.


=== Stain remover ===
A solution of dishwashing liquid and water may be used to remove coffee, tea, soda and fruit juice stains from fabrics. One dishwashing liquid brand has been used to remove stains from white or lightly-colored cloth napkins.


=== Treatment for oil-affected birds and other wildlife ===

Dishwashing liquid has been used to treat birds affected by oil spills. After the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, the International Bird Rescue Research Center received hundreds of cases of dishwashing liquid that were used to clean up birds and other animals contaminated with spilled oil. More dishwashing liquid was donated during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to the International Bird Rescue Research Center and the Marine Mammal Center. Some dishwashing soap brands donated to support oiled birds during the Deepwater Horizon spill have received criticism for being petroleum-based.
Dish soap has been tested as an oil-removing agent on polar bear fur in a study by the Alaska Zoo should a spill occur in the Arctic.
