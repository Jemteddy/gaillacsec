Ptychochrominae is a subfamily in the cichlid family of fish. It includes about 14 species. They are restricted to lakes and rivers in Madagascar, and the majority are threatened. Most cichlid genera native to Madagascar are included in this subfamily; the only exceptions are Paretroplus (subfamily Etroplinae) and Paratilapia (sometimes included in Ptychochrominae, but likely belongs in its own subfamily).
