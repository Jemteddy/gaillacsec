Casuarictin is an ellagitannin, a type of hydrolysable tannin. It can be found in Casuarina and Stachyurus species.
It is formed from two hexahydroxydiphenic acid and one gallic acid units linked to a glucose molecule.
The molecule is formed from tellimagrandin II, itself formed from pentagalloyl glucose via oxidation. Casuarictin is transformed into pedunculagin via loss of a gallate group, and further into castalagin via glucose pyranose ring opening.
