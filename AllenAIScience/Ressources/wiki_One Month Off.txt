"One Month Off" is the third single from Bloc Party's third album, Intimacy. It was released on 26 January 2009 only on 7-inch vinyl and digital download.
The music video was made by Team D.A.D.D.Y and features footage from Ray Harryhausen's fairy tale stop motion films, augmented by CGI scenes of war. The band does not appear in the music video.
The song was popular on alternative-formatted radio stations in the United States and peaked at number 49 on the Mediabase alternative chart. However, the release charted lower in the UK than any other Bloc Party single, at #170.
