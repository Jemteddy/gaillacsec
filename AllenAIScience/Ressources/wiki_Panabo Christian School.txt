=== A Brief Historical Perspective: PCS PROFILE ===

PANABO CHRISTIAN SCHOOL is based in the Poblacion, of Panabo City, along the Davao-Agusan national highway, Davao. Its official operation started in 1987, when it offered a Summer Enrichment course to a set of Preschoolers, and Graders. Basically, the course consisted of play activities involving alphabet sounds and for the graders, the lessons revolved around 3R's: Reading, 'Riting and 'Rithmetic because the thrust then was "Return to the Basics." Thirty-eight Summerians received certificates of completion after the summer course on May 30, 1987.
Enrolment period started thereafter for Nursery, Kinder I and Il and Grade One and Two pupils. Strength for such operation was Gov’t Permit No.030, S. 1987 dated May 1987. That was the official start of PCS ministry in the municipality of Panabo. The following year, an application to operate complete elementary was filed and Government Recognition was released soon after. With DECS Recognition No. 019, s. 1989, PCS was grateful to have as its pioneer elementary graduates 14 members and kindergarten graduates 40 members. They were officially confirmed by a DECS representative on March 19, 1989. With the inspiration coming from the parents themselves, Permit to operate the complete Secondary curriculum was applied for and Government Permit No.006, s. 1991 dated April 1991 was released. On the initial year of such operation, there were 2 sections in the First Year and one section each for the second, third and fourth years. School Year 1993-1994 was the third year of operation of the High School Department, which was administered by Mrs. MaryHelen R. Ortiz. There were 2 sections in the First to Third Year and one section in the Fourth Year, with an enrolment of 43 students. School Year 2000-2001 was the 13th year of existence of PCS serving as a Non-Sectarian Educational Institution in the progressive community of Panabo. Teaching Force numbered 32, with the Elementary Dept. administered by Mrs. Nita Avila-Yelo. Her official designation as per DepEd standard is Principal, with 15 teachers; while the High School Dept. had 17 Faculty members. Support staff consists of I Library Aide, 2 Maintenance Aide and 2 Watchmen, all working full-time. With PCS office consistently guiding and encouraging all the teachers, Students’ and Pupils’ performance improved. All requirements towards the Government Recognition was worked for until the desired Government Recognition was finally released on July 19, 2006. With joy and thanksgiving, PCS started to stand on equal footing together with the other Institutions of Panabo with the release of Gov’t. Recognition no. 03, s. 2006.
