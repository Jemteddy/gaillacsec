Lithium chlorate is the inorganic chemical compound with the formula LiClO3. Like all chlorates, it is an oxidizer and may become unstable and possibly explosive if mixed with organic materials, reactive metal powders, or sulfur.
It can be manufactured by the reaction of hot, concentrated lithium hydroxide with chlorine:
3 Cl2 + 6 LiOH â†’ 5 LiCl + LiClO3 + 3 H2O
Lithium chlorate has a very high solubility in water. It is also a 6-electron oxidant. Its electrochemical reduction is facilitated by acid, electrocatalysts and redox mediators. These properties make LiClO3 an interesting oxidant for high energy density flow batteries. | Battery_ref = <http://www.google.com/patents/US20140170511
