An auditory illusion is an illusion of hearing, the aural equivalent of an optical illusion: the listener hears either sounds which are not present in the stimulus, or "impossible" sounds. In short, auditory illusions highlight areas where the human ear and brain, as organic, makeshift tools, differ from perfect audio receptors (for better or for worse).
Examples of auditory illusions:
Binaural beats
the constant spectrum melody
Deutsch's scale illusion
Franssen effect
Glissando illusion
Illusory continuity of tones
Illusory discontinuity
hearing a missing fundamental frequency, given other parts of the harmonic series
Various psychoacoustic tricks of lossy audio compression
McGurk effect
Octave illusion/Deutsch's High-Low Illusion
the Shepard-Risset tone or scale, and the Deutsch tritone paradox
According to Purwins, auditory illusions have been used effectively by various composers, e.g. Beethoven (Leonore), Berg (Wozzek), Krenek (Spiritus Intelligentiae Sanctus), Ligeti (Piano etudes, Violin Concerto, Doppelkonzert für Flöte, Oboe und Orchester), Honegger (Pazific), Stahnke (Partota), Reutter (The Shephard’s Flute from Orchestral Set No. 1).
