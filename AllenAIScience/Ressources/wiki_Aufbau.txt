Aufbau (German for "building up, construction") is a journal targeted at German-speaking Jews around the globe founded in 1934. Hannah Arendt, Albert Einstein, Thomas Mann, and Stefan Zweig wrote for the publication. Until 2004 it was published in New York. It is now published in Zürich.


== History ==
The Aufbau was originally founded by the German-Jewish Club, which was later renamed the New World Club. The original purpose of the journal was as a monthly newsletter for the club, which included information and helpful facts for Jewish refugees.


=== Manfred George ===
The purpose of the publication changed markedly when, in 1939, Manfred George was nominated as the new editor. George took the journal from a monthly newsletter to one of the leading anti-Nazi publications of the German press in exile (Exilpresse). George, within the first 5 years of his tenure, took the circulation of the journal from 8,000 to 40,000. Manfred George was nominated as the new editor of the Aufbau in 1939. Before that he was a well-known editor of a Berlin daily, Tempo, and a left-wing journalist in the Weimar Republic


== The Aufbau database ==
From September 1, 1944 through September 27, 1946, the Aufbau printed numerous lists of Jewish Holocaust survivors located in Europe, as well as a few lists of victims. The data include information taken from lists which appeared between late 1944 and early 1947. The lists published in Aufbau were prepared by many different organizations, often by Jewish relief organizations or by officials in displaced persons’ camps.


== The Aufbau Indexing Project ==
The Aufbau Indexing Project (AIP) is an online database of names that appeared in announcements published in the "Aufbau".

"The goal of the Aufbau Indexing Project is to index all the announcements of birth, engagement, marriage, death and other special occasions that appeared in the pages of Aufbau between 1934 and 2004. This project will allow individuals researching their German-Jewish ancestry to easily locate announcements relevant to their research. [...] To date the AIP has indexed more than 27,000 announcements, mostly from the time period 1975–2002. These records are now available as a searchable database on this site. However, a great amount of work remains. In the peak years 1940–1960, there were two to three pages of announcements in each issue. This translates to more than 150,000 announcements over the course of Aufbau's 65+ years." The Aufbau Indexing Project
