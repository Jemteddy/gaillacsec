Extension Scouting is a programme within Scouting which caters for young people with special needs.
Extension Scouting for young people with special needs was originally called Scouts Malgr√© Tout, which is French for "Scouts Despite Everything". It aims to meet the mandate from the founder of Scouting Robert Baden-Powell that the programme be made "open to all".
Many young people with special needs join in with Scout Groups on a regular basis, but some organisations provide a parallel programme specifically tailored to these members. For example, The Scout Association of the United Kingdom has various Scoutlink groups around the country. The Extension Scouting section in the Netherlands is named "Blauwe Vogels" (Blue Birds) after the play L'Oiseau Bleu by Maurice Maeterlinck. The Extension Scouting section of Scouts en Gidsen Vlaanderen is named "AKABE", Anders KAn BEst (Different is all-right).
