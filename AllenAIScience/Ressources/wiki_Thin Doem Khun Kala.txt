Thin-Dim in Thai means the place that lives for a long time and Kun-Ka-RA means macaque monkeys. The two words together mean the place that has macaque monkeys living for a long time. Kun-Ka-RA were a pair of macaque monkeys that hurt their hands because they use their hands to dip in to coconuts and could not take their hands out until the hands rotted. Each macaque monkey received the grace from King Bhumibol and was treated by a doctor.
