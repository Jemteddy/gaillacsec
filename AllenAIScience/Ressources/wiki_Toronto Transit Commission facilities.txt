== Planned ==
McNicoll Bus Garage
In 2006 the TTC was proposing lands near Kennedy Road and McNicoll Avenue be acquired to build a bus garage. TTC hosted a public open house on November 27, 2013 to gather input from residence and area businesses. TTC has advised within the next five years, the TTC will need a new bus garage to accommodate its growing ridership and expanding bus fleet. Zoning by-laws allow the bus garage to be built as it is zoned for "Heavy Industrial". Residents raised concerns regarding increase emissions, added traffic, disruption of noise from early morning, and late evening bus traffic. TTC will run an Environmental Project Report to address these concerns. This will also include a Traffic Impact Study to determine what options will be needed. 
Mount Dennis/Weston Road LRT carhouse

A planned maintenance and storage facility for the Eglinton Crosstown LRT would be built on a derelict parcel of land between Weston Road and Black Creek Drive. The derelict parcel was a Kodak plant for almost 100 years. The yard will be adjacent to the Weston Road LRT station and a new GO train station.
