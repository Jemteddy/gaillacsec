Arganasuchus is a genus of rauisuchid archosaur. Its fossils have been found in Upper Triassic rocks of the Argana Basin, Morocco. It is based on remains found in the 1970s and initially thought to belong to the rauisuchian Ticinosuchus. Bones recovered include part of the upper jaws, neck vertebrae, and hip bones. Arganasuchus was described in 2007 by Nour-Eddine Jalil and Karin Peyer. The type species is A. dutuiti. Arganasuchus had several anatomical details in common with the rauisuchids Batrachotomus, Fasolasuchus, and Postosuchus.
