Cheer is a laundry detergent sold in the United States and Canada. It is manufactured by Procter & Gamble.
It was introduced in 1950, and after a slight reformulation in 1952, was a highly successful follow up to P&G's Tide product from 1948-49.
Cheer is recognized for its distinctive blue granules. The 1952 formula ("Blue-Magic Whitener") was designed to clean as well as perform bluing, which makes white clothing look whiter (this was traditionally a separate process). Magazine and television ads at the time proclaimed, "...washes clothes so clean, so white, you don't need bluing or bleach!" This was well known as a sponsor of I Love Lucy. Kinescopes exist of 1950s soap opera episodes with commercials for Cheer still intact, it being a sponsor of shows like The Brighter Day.
In the 1960s, the brand was repositioned as "All Temperature Cheer" or as it was also known, "All-Tempa-Cheer", as it was formulated to clean clothes effectively in all water temperatures.
The brand is currently known as "Cheer Colorguard" and "Cheer Brightclean."
Favorite laundry detergent of the Jerry Seinfeld character as seen in the episode "The Sponge".
As of July 2014, Cheer detergent is still being sold, albeit as a budget detergent. Tide Plus Colorguard replaced Cheer as the premium color care detergent.
