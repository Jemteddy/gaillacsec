This is a list of national television ratings for Major League Baseball's (MLB) World Series since 1984. Only United States audience totals are included, not Canadian television ratings, although the 1992 and 1993 World Series were highly watched in Canada.
The highest average rating for an entire World Series is tied between the 1978 Series featuring the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers and the 1980 Series featuring the Philadelphia Phillies and Kansas City Royals. Both Series, each of which went six games, averaged a national rating of 32.8 and a share of 56. However, the 1978 Series had a slightly larger total viewership (44,278,950) than 1980 (42,300,000).
The highest-rated individual game in Series history was Game 7 in 1986, as the New York Mets defeated the Boston Red Sox at Shea Stadium in New York City. The game had a 38.9 national rating and a 55 share. This broke the record established two nights before, in which 52% of televisions in use in the US were tuned in to see the Mets' famous Game 6 comeback that forced a Game 7.
The lowest-rated World Series game came in 2008, as only 9.836 million people watched Game 3 between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Tampa Bay Rays; a rain delay moved the start of the game to after 10 p.m. on the East Coast with the game not ending until 1:47 a.m. It had an all-time low rating of 6.1, matched later by Game 3 in 2012 between the San Francisco Giants and the Detroit Tigers.
The least-watched World Series was in 2012, a four-game sweep of the Detroit Tigers by the San Francisco Giants that averaged a 7.6 rating and 12 share.
