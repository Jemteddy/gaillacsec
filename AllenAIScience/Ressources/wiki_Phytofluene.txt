Phytofluene is a carotenoid pigment with an orange color found naturally in tomatoes and other vegetables. It is the second product of carotenoid biosynthesis. It is formed from phytoene in a desaturation reaction leading to the formation of five conjugated double bonds. In the following step, addition of carbon-carbon conjugated double bonds leads to the formation of z-carotene and appearance of visible color.
Phytofluene has an absorption spectra in the UVA range, with maximal absorption at 348 nm and with Îµ1% of 1557.
Analysis of several fruits and vegetables showed that phytoene and phytofluene are found in majority of fruits and vegetables. In contrast to all other carotenoids, phytoene and phytofluene, the first carotenoid precursors in the biosynthetic pathway of other carotenoids absorb light in the UV range.
Dietary phytoene and phytofluene are accumulated in human skin. The accumulation of these carotenoids may protect the skin by several mechanisms: acting as UV absorbers, as antioxidants, as anti-inflammatory agents.
