They Were Wrong, So We Drowned is the second album released by noise rock band Liars, released in 2004.
The album takes the form of a very loose concept album concerning witchcraft upon The Brocken (a mountain) during Walpurgis Night, and tales of witch trials in the area around the Harz Mountains in Germany. The recording coincided with the band's relocation from Williamsburg, Brooklyn to the woods of rural New Jersey, which also inspired the initial direction of the album.
The focus upon the Brocken legends came when one of the band members mistakenly entered "Brocken Witch" into a search engine while researching the song "Broken Witch".
The album received extremely mixed reviews and sold poorly compared to their debut. However, after the following album, Drum's Not Dead, was released, this album received more attention and the opinion turned more positive.
The album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.
