The 2015 Canadian Championship (officially the Amway Canadian Championship for sponsorship reasons) is a soccer tournament hosted and organized by the Canadian Soccer Association. It will be the eighth edition of the annual Canadian Championship, and will take place in the cities of Edmonton, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver in 2015. The participating teams will be Ottawa Fury FC and FC Edmonton of the North American Soccer League, the second-level of the Canadian Soccer Pyramid, and Montreal Impact, Toronto FC and Vancouver Whitecaps FC of Major League Soccer, the first-level of Canadian club soccer. Montreal Impact are the two-time defending champions.
The winner awarded the Voyageurs Cup will become Canada's entry into the Group Stage of the 2016–17 CONCACAF Champions League. This is a permanent change from procedure used in the past, where the Canadian Champion qualified for the CONCACAF Champions League beginning the same year (in this case, 2015–16).
The tournament moved to an April–August timeframe from its usual April–June timeframe to accommodate the schedule of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup held in Canada. It will permanently move to a June/July timeframe in 2016.


== Matches ==


=== Bracket ===
The three Major League Soccer and two NASL Canadian clubs have been seeded according to their final position in 2014 league play, with both NASL clubs playing in the preliminary round, the winner of which advances to the semifinals.
All rounds of the competition are played via a two leg home and away knock-out format. The higher seeded team has the option of deciding which leg it plays at home, usually the second leg. The team which scores the greater aggregate of goals in the two matches advances. As previous years, the team that comes on top on aggregate for the two matches is declared champion and earns the right to represent Canada in the 2016–17 CONCACAF Champions League.
Each series is a two-game aggregate goal series with the away goals rule.
