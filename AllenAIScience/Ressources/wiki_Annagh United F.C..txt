== History ==
Tandragee Road has been the club's home since 1983. Indeed when the club opened its new pitch a Northern Irish star player of the time, the great George Best turned out in an Annagh United select side. The club run two senior teams, with the reserve team playing in the Championship Reserve League and managed by Paul Matchett. More recently the club have developed youth teams who play in the Mid Ulster / Lisburn Youth Leagues. In the 2009–10 season however, the team finished near the bottom of the league and manager Wilkinson parted company with the club. In late July David Johnstone ex Loughgall caretaker manager was appointed manager with Michael Crowe the backroom staff. Johnstone played for Ards, Carrick Rangers, Larne and Loughgall. Recent seasons have brought some notable cup runs, none less than 2006–07 under the reign of Niall Currie, now boss at Loughgall, when they reached the Mid-Ulster Cup final against local senior club Newry City and the Irish Intermediate Cup Semi-final against Coagh United. Ironically, Annagh lost out to the latter team in the Bob Radcliffe Cup semi-final earlier in that season. Johnstone has since departed the club and the temporary management team of players Dean Smith, Darragh Peden and Alan Murphy took over. Dean Smith has now been confirmed as manager for the 2013-14 season with Alan Murphy assistant and Darragh Peden coach.
