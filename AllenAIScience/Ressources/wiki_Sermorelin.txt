Sermorelin (INN) (trade name is Geref), also known as GHRH (1-29), is a growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) analogue used as a diagnostic agent. It is a 29-amino acid polypeptide representing the 1â€“29 fragment from endogenous human GHRH, and is thought to be the shortest fully functional fragment of GHRH. It is used as a diagnostic agent to assess growth hormone (GH) secretion. It is also used as doping agent in sports due to its correlation with increased growth of muscular and skeletal tissue. Sermorelin use is also hypothesized to improve deep rapid eye movement sleep.
