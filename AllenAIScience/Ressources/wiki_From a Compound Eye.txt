From a Compound Eye is a Robert Pollard CD and double LP released in 2006. Though Pollard had already released several albums under his own name, this album, being the first released after the 2004 dissolution of his longtime vehicle Guided by Voices, was considered to be the official commencement of his solo career.
For the album, Pollard drew on his backlog of unreleased material, as well as newly composed songs. Rather than record with the band setup typical of GbV recordings, Pollard recorded basic guitar and vocal tracks within a matter of days, and left instrumental work to be overdubbed almost entirely by collaborator Todd Tobias who produced the last few GbV LPs. Clarifying the title, Pollard described the album as "Massive...Epic...it's all over the place and sees in all directions at once" [1]
It was the first Robert Pollard solo release to chart on any Billboard chart, peaking at #38 on the Heatseekers chart and #41 on the Top Independent Albums chart [2].
