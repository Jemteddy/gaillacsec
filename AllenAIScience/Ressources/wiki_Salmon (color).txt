Salmon is a range of pale pinkish-orange to light pink colors, named after the color of salmon flesh.
The web color salmon is displayed at right.
The first recorded use of salmon as a color name in English was in 1776.
The actual colour of salmon flesh varies from almost white to deep pink, depending on their levels of the carotenoid astaxanthin due to how rich a diet of krill and shrimp the fish feeds on; salmon raised on fish farms are given artificial coloring in their food.
