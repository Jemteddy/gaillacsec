Aptery is the anatomical condition of an animal completely lacking any kind of wings. An animal with this condition is said to be apterous.
Most animal species belong to and are phylogenetic descendants of apterous taxa. These groups are said to be primarily apterous.
Apterous animals which belong to or are phylogenetic descendants of winged taxa are said to be secondarily apterous.
