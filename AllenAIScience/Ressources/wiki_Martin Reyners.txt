Martin Everardus Reyners (born 1950), Auckland, New Zealand FRSNZ Ph.D., is a New Zealand geophysicist and seismologist. He is a Principal Scientist at the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences (GNS Science), Lower Hutt, and is a specialist in subinduction zones, especially in relation to New Zealand.


== Education ==
He was educated at St Peter's College, Auckland and the University of Auckland (Ph.D (Geophysics) - 1978).


== Career ==
His work has "enabled three-dimensional tomographic imaging of the structure of the colliding plates" and has so shown the modus operandi of plate tectonics under New Zealand, especially in relation to the Taupo Volcanic Zone, which is "the most frequently active and productive silicic volcanic system on Earth." He has cast light on the mysterious termination of volcanic activity at Mt Ruapehu and its non-continuation with the subducted Pacific plate further south under New Zealand" He is currently examining why the New Zealand tectonic plates are jammed together in some places because, if these unjam, there could be a large earthquake
He is a fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand (FRSNZ), and has been awarded the Hochstetter Lectureship, and (twice) the New Zealand Geophysics Prize.
