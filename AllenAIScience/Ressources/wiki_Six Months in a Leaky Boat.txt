"Six Months in a Leaky Boat" is a single from New Zealand art rock group Split Enz's album Time and Tide. It was written by Tim Finn and released as a single in 1982.
The song is a reference to the time it took pioneers to sail to Australia and New Zealand (hence the reference to "the tyranny of distance" - a history by Geoffrey Blainey), and a metaphor that refers to lead singer Tim Finn's nervous breakdown.
The song was "discouraged from airplay" in Britain during the Falklands crisis by the BBC for reasons of morale - it was thought that references to leaky boats was not appropriate during the naval action in the war.
