CFU-GM (or "GMP", for "granulocyte-macrophage progenitor") is a colony forming unit. It is derived from CFU-GEMM.
The "GM" stands for "granulocyte, monocyte".
It is the precursor for monoblasts and myeloblasts.
Production is stimulated by granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).


== Granulocytes ==
There is some controversy over which granulocytes derive from CFU-GM.
There is little disagreement that neutrophils come from CFU-GM.
Some sources state that basophils also derive from CFU-GM, but that eosinophils come from "CFU-Eos".
Other sources state that basophils do not derive from CFU-GM, but from a distinct CFU, titled "CFU-Baso".
