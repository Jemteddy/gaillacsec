Porangahau, a township close to the Pacific Ocean coast in the south-east of the North Island of New Zealand, has a very small population. It lies in the southernmost part of Hawke's Bay, 45 kilometres south of Waipukurau, and close to the mouth of the Porangahau River. There is a marae at Porangahau.
The MƒÅori name Porangahau expresses the idea of a night (po) of pursuit or of retreat (rangahau).
Six kilometres northeast of the township stands an insubstantial hill noted for its substantial name: Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu.
