The Directorate of Military Intelligence was part of the War Office from the 19th century until absorbed by Defence Intelligence in the Ministry of Defence in 1964. Its sections were numbered and often referred to as "M.I. number". The names MI5 and MI6 retain wide currency, although the bodies are no longer within the Ministry of Defence.
