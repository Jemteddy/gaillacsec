The Magpie River is a river in the Côte-Nord region of Quebec which flows from the Labrador Plateau to empty into the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River east of Sept-Îles, Quebec. The river is 200 km in length.
In 2004, a plan by a private company to construct a small hydroelectric plant on the river generated protests by environmentalists, including Robert F. Kennedy, Jr..
The river is popular with white-water rafting, canoeing and kayaking enthusiasts.
