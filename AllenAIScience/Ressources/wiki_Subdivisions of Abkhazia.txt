In Soviet times, the Abkhazian ASSR was divided into 6 raions (districts) named after their respective capitals.
The administrative divisions of the disputed Republic of Abkhazia have stayed the same, with one exception: in 1995 the Tkvarcheli District was created around the town of Tkvarcheli from parts of the Ochamchira and Gali raions.
The Georgian government, which claims Abkhazia as an Autonomous region but lacks control, has not changed the Soviet divisions.


== Districts of Abkhazia ==
Districts are led by the Head of the Administration, who is simultaneously Mayor of the District's capital, except in the case of Sukhumi. The Head of the Administration is appointed by the President from among the District Assembly, although the President may appoint acting Heads from without. Despite proposals to elect the Head directly by the population, on 30 July 2015, the People's Assembly of Abkhazia almost unanimously voted not to change the procedure.

== Historic regions of Abkhazia ==
Abkhazia has traditionally been divided into several historical regions (they roughly correspond to modern districts that are given in parentheses):
Sadzen (Gagra district and Sochi region which is now in Russia)
Bzyb (Gudauta district)
Gumaa (Sukhumi district)
Abzhywa (Ochamchira and partly Tkvarcheli districts)
Samurzakano (Gali and partly Tkvarcheli district)
Dal-Tsabal (Gulripshi district)
These are the regions mentioned in the Abkhazian Constitution of 1994. According to the popular (but erroneous) belief the seven stripes of the Abkhazian flag correspond to the seven historical regions of the country, the seventh one being Pskhu-Aibga.
