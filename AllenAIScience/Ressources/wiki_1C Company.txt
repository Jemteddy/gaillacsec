== History ==

1C was founded in 1991 by Boris Nuraliev in Moscow, Russia. The company goal was to provide a software solution to business owners giving them a system that required little or no accounting and development experience.
Both Akella's Sea Dog studio and 1C:Ino-Co (founded as Ino-Co) were acquired in 2007, and 1C Company began to take substantial steps aimed at expansion into the North American video gaming market with distribution deals with Atari, and an appearance at E3 2007. In 2008 the company signed deals for exclusive rights to distribute PC and console games in Russia and CIS countries with titles by Electronic Arts and Gamecock Media Group, and began to offer games for online distribution. By 2009, 1C owned and operated 280 stores with another 4000 franchises based on the 1C license in 600 locations across the former Soviet bloc, and in February of the same year 1C merged with SoftClub (the largest Russian console game publisher and distibutor).
