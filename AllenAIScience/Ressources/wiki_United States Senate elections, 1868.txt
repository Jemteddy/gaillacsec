The United States Senate election of 1868 was an election which had the Republican Party gain five seats in the United States Senate, enlarging their already overwhelming majority to the largest amount of seats ever controlled by the party.
As this election was prior to ratification of the seventeenth amendment, Senators were chosen by State legislatures.
