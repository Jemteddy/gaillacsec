CFRV-FM is a radio station broadcasting out of Lethbridge, Alberta on a frequency of 107.7 FM. The station, branded as The River, plays an adult contemporary format since 2007 (prior to this, they were a hot AC station), the same time CJBZ-FM shifted from adult hits to contemporary hit radio. This format change was to compete against CJOC. This makes Lethbridge the largest Alberta market without a hot adult contemporary radio station, having overtaken from Edmonton in February 2010, virtually the same time when CKNO-FM signed on the air.
