Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People (abbreviated as SBCG4AP) is an episodic graphic adventure based on the Homestar Runner web cartoon, with Strong Bad as the lead character. It is developed by Telltale Games. A total of five episodes were released for Microsoft Windows and WiiWare between August 11, 2008 and December 15, 2008. It was released on the PlayStation 3 in North America on December 21, 2010, and in other regions at a later time. There is also an OS X version.


== GameplayEdit ==
Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People uses point and click mechanics. The player plays as Strong Bad, one of the most popular characters in the Homestar Runner online flash animation series, as he goes through his life, interacting with characters. Each game contains a different goal that the player must reach by talking to characters and using items.
Apart from the point and click mechanics, each episode features an arcade-style minigame. For example, the first episode features a top-down boxing game called Snake Boxer 5. Other features include a customizable map, hidden and collectible items such as 3Ã—5 cards used to create Teen Girl Squad comics, and the ability to take pictures to send to friends through WiiConnect24 or by e-mail (depending on the version used).

== DevelopmentEdit ==
The series was first hinted at in a Homestar Runner short posted on YouTube, called "Strong Bad Gameways", a parody of pre-flight safety demonstrations with the Wii Remote. The game itself was officially announced on April 10, 2008 in a press release from Telltale Games. A second season may be made if the first season sells well.
According to Mark Darin, lead designer of the series at Telltale Games, both Mike and Matt Chapman, the creators of Homestar Runner, were quite involved in the production process of the games, even early on, "In the design phase, we have brainstorming sessions with them where they contribute to the ideas that will eventually become the plot of the episodes. Then one of our designers will write the episode script and pass that along to the brothers where they review, edit and rewrite whatever feels necessary to make the whole thing feel more "Strong Bad-y."

N-Europe gave the game a 9/10, praising its many in-jokes and references to the Homestar Runner cartoons and its simple but clever use of WiiConnect24. They were however concerned that players who haven't watched the Flash cartoons will be a little lost and unsatisfied in regards to some scenarios, characters and jokes. IGN gave the game an 8.1 out of 10, with the authentic presentation, voice work, music and the opening song impressing them the most. They also believed the game to be a must download for fans, but felt that the experience was short-lived and doesn't break any new ground for the genre. In contrast, GameSpot believed the cartoon's humor did not translate well to an adventure game, and gave it a 5/10. ONM gave it 88%, naming it one of the best WiiWare games so far, but that the humour in it isn't for everyone. It was awarded Best Voice Acting for the Wii by IGN in its 2008 video game awards IGN also made it a nominee for Best Story and Best WiiWare Game., this is the only Episode to be rated T.

IGN, which gave the game 8.2/10, echoed their assessment from their Homestar Ruiner review, noting the game to be slightly longer and more complete than its predecessor, yet still geared very much towards fans. GameSpot, who disliked the first episode, gave Strong Badia the Free a 7.0/10, believing the game was a marked improvement with a more linear and original plot, and funnier jokes they felt did not need to prop up the weak gameplay noted in its predecessor.
