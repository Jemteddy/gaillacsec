The motion to consider by paragraph or seriatim is used to consider separately the different parts of a report or long motion consisting of a series of resolutions, paragraphs, articles, or sections that are not totally separate questions. In this way, this motion is distinct from a division of the question, which is used to split a motion into two separate motions, each of which can stand independently if the other fails.
