The Ateneo Blue Eagles is the collegiate men's varsity basketball team of the Ateneo de Manila University that plays in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), the premiere sports league in the Philippines. The collegiate women's varsity basketball team is called the Lady Eagles while the high school varsity basketball team is called the Blue Eaglets.
The Ateneo collegiate men's varsity basketball team was not always called the Blue Eagles. It got the name Blue Eagles when Ateneo adopted the Eagle as its mascot in 1938. Prior to that, from 1914 it was known under different names.
Ateneo has fifteen collegiate men's varsity teams that participate in fifteen sporting events of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines, its mother league. Only the men's varsity basketball team is called the Blue Eagles. The other fourteen men's varsity teams have their own unique name to help differentiate them. The sports editors of The Guidon, the school's official student publication, are credited for the choice of these various names.
Thru the years, the Ateneo Blue Eagles have achieved excellence in sports. They have the most number of NCAA/UAAP basketball championships combined, from 1924 to 2015, due to a robust sports program: hiring competent local and foreign coaches, the availability of state-of-the art sports training facilities on campus, recruitment of top athletes, development of home-grown talents and an envious sports tradition.
Most Blue Eagles have succeeded well in their post-collegiate days. They have become senators of the country, civil court judges, lawyers, bankers, engineers, doctors to name a few. Their success in life after graduating from college is attributable to their being strictly treated as student-athletes in school and not campus celebrities with privileges.
Twenty years after playing their last game as Blue Eagles, the Board of Directors of the Ateneo Sports Hall of Fame review their playing years as Blue Eagles. Those who meet the criteria are inducted into the Ateneo Sports Hall of Fame.


== Team Monikers ==
When Ateneo started to participate in intercollegiate sports in 1914, its varsity basketball teams were simply referred to by the school community as the Ateneo Seniors and Ateneo Juniors. They were later dubbed the Blue and Whites by the sports press in the early 1920s when Ateneo joined sports leagues. When Ateneo adopted the Eagle as its mascot in 1938, the college and high school varsity basketball teams were given new names, the Blue Eagles and Blue Eaglets. The Ateneo Blue Eagles are sometimes called the Hail Mary Quintet by the sports press. This moniker was given to the Blue Eagles in 1926 when the sports press reporters noticed that the team would pray the Hail Mary during game time-outs and would win by the skin of their teeth. Ateneo also has a varsity basketball training team which is officially called Team B but popularly referred to by its nickname Team Glory Be. According to former Ateneo Blue Eagle and current Team B head coach Yuri Escueta (AB IS ’08), the team got its nickname from a former Team B player, Mark Badua. As Escueta recalls, "Team A has always been called the ‘Hail Mary Team’ so [Badua] named us ‘Glory Be’ since we were known as Team B." 
The first women's varsity basketball team was formed in 1974. It joined the league called Women's National Collegiate Athletic Association (WNCAA) and was named the Blue Eaglettes. This was later changed to Lady Eagles when they transferred to the UAAP. No written article has been found to date to explain why and to provide the exact year this name change happened.  
Ateneo is one of the four UAAP member schools that participate in all of the fifteen sporting events of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. The Eagle is the mascot of all the varsity teams participating in these sporting events. However, only the men's varsity basketball team is called the Blue Eagles for purposes of distinction. The names of the other varsity teams also have the word blue (except the women's varsity) as part of their moniker to signify that it is an Ateneo team, since blue is one of the school's colors. The varsity team names which are sourced from the school's official student publications are as follows:


== Mascot and Colors ==
Ateneo has long been involved in intercollegiate sports dating back to 1914. It was a pioneer in Philippine collegiate sports. Ateneo was the first Philippine school to adopt a mascot, and was also the first school to field an organized cheering squad with cheerleaders which was later followed by another first when it introduced a Pep Band to augment the cheerleaders during games.
The choice of an eagle as school mascot holds iconic significance. Conferred with the title "the King", the Blue Eagle is a reference to the "high-flying" Ateneo varsity teams which would "swoop down on the foe and sweep up the fields away" as a dominating force in the field of sports. Furthermore, there is some mythological significance to the eagle as a symbol of power.
The school used to have live eagles as pets in the Padre Faura campus and later on at the Grade School campus in Loyola Heights. A live eagle would lead the men's varsity basketball team at the start of a game in the NCAA as the team enters the basketball court for their warm-up with the school Band playing the fight song, "Blue Eagle - The King".
Blue and White, being the colors of the school's patroness the Blessed Virgin Mary, were chosen as the school's colors. Thus blue and white are the colors of the uniforms of the varsity teams. Most of the school songs, yells and cheers have the words blue and white.


== Member Various Athletic Associations ==
The Ateneo de Manila University is a member of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines, the premiere sports league in the country. It fields teams in all fifteen sporting events of the league. Ateneo was a founding member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which was established in 1924. It left the NCAA in 1978 due to the league-wide violence prevalent at the time, and then joined the UAAP in the same year.
Aside from the UAAP, the Ateneo also participates in other sports leagues/tournaments such as the Father Martin Cup, Fil-Oil Flying V Preseason Cup, Philippine University Games (Unigames), Philippine Collegiate Championship League (PCCL), Shakey's V-League, Rizal Football Association (RIFA), Philippine Athletic Youth Association (PAYA), Private Schools Athletic Development Association (PRADA) <High School and Grade School> and the Best Passerelle/ Small Basketeers Program (SBP) <Grade School and High School>. The Ateneo also fields sports teams to the Jesuit Invitational Games (JIGs), an athletic tournament participated by eight Jesuit schools in the Philippines.

Rivals
The Blue Eagles have had several rivalries throughout the years. Before the NCAA was founded and into the early years after its foundation (1924), Ateneo's fiercest basketball rivals were the UP Fighting Maroons (then known as the Maroon and Greens). Ateneo won its first NCAA seniors basketball title in 1928 while the San Beda Red Lions won their first in 1927, and the two went on to develop a rivalry during the 1930s that lasted up to the 1970s. The two schools dominated the NCAA as they traded championships, back-to-back and three-peats. When Ateneo left the NCAA in 1978, it had the most mumber of basketball championship titles in that league at 14 to the 10 of San Beda.
While the Ateneo-San Beda rivalry was ongoing, the seed for a future rivalry was planted after an Ateneo loss to La Salle in the championship game of NCAA season 16 (1939–40). Games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hotly contested but not yet tagged by the sportswriters as a rivalry. When Ateneo and La Salle transferred to the UAAP, San Beda was left in the NCAA. Ateneo and La Salle continued their hotly contested games into the UAAP and the sports press started to write about a rivalry. The basketball games between the Blue Eagles and the Green Archers are the most anticipated matches in every UAAP season. During the 1988 season, Ateneo was the defending champion and they faced La Salle in the Finals. A deep Ateneo lineup ended up winning the crown, triggering a full-blown rivalry. Recently, the intensity of the rivalry has picked up due to Ateneo and La Salle meeting in the UAAP Finals thrice, in 2001 (won by La Salle), 2002 (won by Ateneo), and 2008 (won by Ateneo). The UAAP is guaranteed high TV ratings and sold-out tickets, resulting in ticket scalping, when Ateneo and La Salle clash on the hardcourt. These games draw huge crowds of students, school faculty/ officials, alums, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators and even a chief justice of the Supreme Court. Former presidents of the Philippines and ambassadors of the United States of America also attend the games.
RecordsUAAP and NCAA
The late Fr. Edgar A. Martin, S.J., Ateneo's college athletic moderator in the 1950s and 1960s, once said that "basketball brings glory to Ateneo". The student-athletes of Ateneo share in this belief. As of the year 2014, Ateneo has 53 combined NCAA (25) and UAAP (28) basketball titles, which include championships won in men's, women's, juniors' and midgets' divisions. This is more than the total number of combined titles in men's, women's, and juniors' divisions held by the University of Santo Tomas, which has 42 (40 UAAP and 2 NCAA), San Beda College, which has 41 NCAA titles, Far Eastern University with 34 UAAP titles, Colegio de San Juan de Letran with 28 NCAA titles, De La Salle University, which has 26 (11 in the NCAA and 15 in the UAAP), and Mapúa Institute of Technology with 25 NCAA titles.


==== Basketball Championships ====
In men's basketball, the Ateneo Blue Eagles have won 22 titles as of 2014, 14 in the NCAA and 8 in the UAAP. The Ateneo Blue Eaglets have 10 NCAA and 18 UAAP titles in juniors basketball, 1 NCAA title in the Midgets division won in 1924, for a total of 29. The Blue Eaglets have won 28 combined NCAA and UAAP titles in the juniors division. This is the most number of juniors title won by a high school team in the major leagues, followed by San Beda and Mapua with 20 each. The Lady Eagles have won two UAAP titles.


==== Double Championships ====
Ateneo has won eight double championships in basketball. These were years when both the Blue Eagles and the Blue Eaglets won the championship in the same year. The years 1975 and 1976 were doubly significant as Ateneo not only won double championships in the NCAA but also a back-to-back double championship, a feat that they repeated with championships in both the seniors and juniors divisions in 2008 and 2009 in the UAAP. In 2010, Ateneo won again the championships in both men's and juniors basketball, annexing the only three-peat double championship in combined UAAP and NCAA history.


==== Consecutive Championships ====

The Blue Eagles have won back-to-back titles six times. Four were won in the NCAA and two in the UAAP. The Blue Eagles became three-peat champions when they won the NCAA title in 1931, 1932 and 1933. They also accomplished a three-peat sweep by going undefeated in these three consecutive seasons, a record which has not been surpassed much less duplicated by any team in the NCAA and UAAP. They were again three-peat champions when they won the championship in 2008, 2009, and 2010, their first in the UAAP. They were the first collegiate team to accomplish a three-peat in both the NCAA and UAAP. In 2011, they joined an elite group in the UAAP when they won the 2011 UAAP Men's Basketball Championship. They became the fourth UAAP team to be four-peat champions, joining UE, UST and La Salle. In 2012, they separated from this group when they won their fifth consecutive title. They are now the sole team in the five-peat championship bracket.
The Blue Eaglets were four-peat champions having won the title in 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986. They were also three-time three-peat champions and eight times, they won back-to-back titles.


==== Elimination Round Sweeps ====
The Ateneo Blue Eaglets have the most number of UAAP elimination round sweeps at seven. The Blue Eagles and Lady Eagles are not as successful. They have not achieved a sweep of the elimination round in the UAAP. However, the Blue Eagles did sweep elimination rounds when they were still playing in the NCAA. They swept the elimination round of three consecutive seasons en route to the 1931, 1932 and 1933 NCAA titles. This double-feat achievement of a three-peat championship via a three-peat sweep is a record that still stands today and may never be broken.


==== UAAP Final 4 Appearances ====
(1993-start of Final 4 format)
In the UAAP, the Blue Eagles hold the record for the longest Final Four consecutive appearances. They made 14 Final Four consecutive appearances from 1999 to 2012 to La Salle's 12, which is the second longest.
The Blue Eaglets have the most number of Final Four appearances at 17 as of 2013. This number does not include the five seasons (1997, 1999, 2006, 2010 and 2014) when the Blue Eaglets swept the elimination round and automatically advanced to the Finals. These 17 Final Four appearances topped four other UAAP high schools which have 12 appearances each as of 2013. The Lady Eagles have made six Final Four appearances as of 2013.


==== Final 4 Triple Appearances ====
The Blue Eagles, Lady Blue Eagles and Blue Eaglets made it to the Final Four in the same season five times.


==== UAAP Finals Appearances ====
The Blue Eagles made eleven trips to the UAAP Finals, and the Lady Eagles had four trips. The Blue Eaglets are tops in the UAAP Finals appearance category. They were in the Finals twenty-nine times. In the Final Four era, they were in the Finals seventeen times as of 2013, while it was ten for second-placer UST Tiger Cubs. The Eaglets also hold the record for the longest Finals consecutive appearance. They were in the Finals in eleven consecutive seasons, from 1994 (season 57) to 2004 (season 67).


==== Blue trivia ====
The Blue Eagles hold the record of winning in the most lopsided game ever in both NCAA-UAAP seniors division history. In NCAA Season 6 (1929), Ateneo blew the NU Bulldogs off the court by the score of 97–9.
The Eagle was not always the King. Up to the 1970s, Ateneo had the most number of collegiate basketball championships in the NCAA. The Blue Eagles had fourteen championship titles when they left the NCAA in 1978. San Beda, their closest rival, was second with only ten championships at that time. When Ateneo transferred to the UAAP, it struggled to soar high as it did in the NCAA. It took the Blue Eagles eleven years to win a championship again. After this back-to-back (1987 and 1988) championship, Ateneo had to wait another fourteen years for their next championship which happened in 2002.
Other Leagues and Tournaments
In addition to the NCAA and UAAP championships, recent victories of the Blue Eagles include the back-to-back titles (2008 and 2009) and the 2011 championship in the annual Philippine University Games, the championship of the Fr. Martin Summer Cup in 2006, 2010 and 2012, and the 2008 Nike Summer League. The Blue Eagles also finally won a championship in the Filoil Flying V Preseason Cup in 2011. This was their first since participating in 2007.
At the national level, the Blue Eagles won the title of the 2007 Collegiate Champions League, and its successor, the Philippine Collegiate Champions League (PCCL) in 2009 and 2010, giving it the most titles among the tournament's winners.
Notable Years
Ateneo was a member of the NCAA for 54 years and is in its 38th year in the UAAP as of 2015. This is a total of 91 years of participation in sports in the major collegiate athletic leagues in the country. In the eleven-year period spanning from 2002 to 2012, at least one UAAP basketball championship trophy was brought home to Loyola Heights by its varsity basketball teams. The Blue and White teams brought home a total of fourteen UAAP championships during this eleven-year span. The Blue Eagles and the Blue Eaglets each contributed six trophies. The Lady Eagles added two more.

During this period, the Ateneo varsity basketball teams achieved various kind of streaks. The Blue Eagles accomplished back-to-back championships after winning the UAAP basketball crown in 2008 and 2009. They were three-peat champions when they won again the UAAP basketball title in 2010, their first in the UAAP. The Blue Eagles achieved another first in the history of their NCAA-UAAP campaigns in 2011 when they won their fourth straight basketball championship. They became four-peat champions for the first time and joined the elite group of three teams that have won four-peat championships in the UAAP. In 2012, they separated from this group when they won their fifth consecutive title. They are now the sole team in the five-peat championship circle.
The Blue Eaglets were back-to-back champions twice, winning the UAAP basketball championships in 2003 and 2004 then in 2008 and 2009. They became three-peat champions when they also won the UAAP title in 2010. All these championships by the Blue Eagles and Blue Eaglets have resulted in double championships. The Eagles and the Eaglets were double champions in 2008, back-to-back double champions in 2009 and three-peat double champions in 2010. Ateneo so far is the only school with a three-peat double championship in combined UAAP and NCAA history. The Lady Eagles have won so far only two UAAP basketball championships. These were won during this era.

The Blue Eagles were in the Final Four in every year during this period. These eleven appearances are part of Ateneo's fourteen Final Four consecutive appearances which is the standing record in the UAAP for the longest Final Four consecutive appearances. During the Blue Era, they made eight Finals appearances and won the championship in six of their appearances. The Lady Eagles made six Final Four appearances and three appearances in the Finals where they won two championships. The Blue Eaglets swept the 2006 and 2010 elimination rounds and were in the Final Four nine times. They won the UAAP basketball championship six times during their eight Finals appearances.
The Blue Eagles were presented the 2012 Athlete of the Year Award by the Philippine Sportswriters Association (PSA), oldest media organization in the Philippines, last March 16, 2013 for achieving a five-peat championship in the UAAP. This is the first and so far the only five-peat championship by a collegiate varsity basketball team in a major league in the third millennium.
The Blue and White varsity basketball teams have also won championships in pre and post season tournaments during this period.

=== Football ===
The Ateneo varsity football teams have won a total 17 championships, 9 in NCAA and 8 in UAAP. In the NCAA, the seniors and juniors teams have won 6 and 3 titles, respectively. The Blue Booters were the first to win a football championship in the NCAA when they won the title on the maiden season of the NCAA in 1924. They also won their first back-to-back (1953 and 1954) championship in the NCAA. In the UAAP, the seniors (men) have won 6 titles while the juniors booters have 2 titles. The Blue Booters were three-peat champions after winning in Seasons 2003-04, 2004–05 and 2005–06, a record that still holds today. The two titles of the Blue Eaglet Booters are back-to-back, Seasons 2008-09 and 2009-10. Football was introduced in the UAAP Juniors Division as a demonstration sport in season 70 (2007–08) and declared a regular sport in season 72 (2009–10).

Football Championships
The football seniors (men) team in the UAAP did not have much success until the mid-1990s, when they reached the UAAP Finals 4 times in a row, from 1996 to 1999. Months after winning the 1995-1996 Chipper Afable Cup (beating NAVY FC in the finals, 3-0, with the help of then HS '97 MVP, Vincent Hubert Reyes), the Blue Booters won their first ever UAAP title in 1996, by beating arch-rival La Salle in the Finals by 2 goals to 1. In the following two years, they lost in the Finals to the Green Archers, but were able to regain the title in 1999.
The 1999 men's football team holds the record for most goals scored in a UAAP game. They scored 41 goals in a 41-0 win over Adamson University. All eleven Ateneo starters scored in this game. Carlos Leus led the way with 13 goals, Monch Espejo with 9 and Paolo Aquino adding 5.
In season 68 (2005–06), The Blue Booters won their fifth UAAP championship in a dominating fashion. They swept the season, 10-0, on their way to the championship. This is a first in the history of UAAP football and the record still holds for Ateneo.
The Blue Booters hold the record for the longest championship streak in the UAAP. They accomplished this when they won the football title in Season 66 (2003–04), Season 67 (2004–05) and Season 68 (2005–06), a three-peat championship achievement. Not to be outdone, the Blue Eaglet Booters also hold the record for the longest championship streak in the UAAP juniors division. They are back-to-back champions as they won the title in Season 71 (2008–09) and Season 72 (2009–10).
The Lady Blue Booters also hold a record, although something that they cannot boast. They have not won a championship in the UAAP and were even the doormat team in Season 74 (2011–12) as they did not win a single game. However, these losing seasons may become a thing of the past. For Season 75 (2012-12), the Lady Blue Booters have three national players in their roster. In the 2012 national University Games, a preseason tournament that is held during the academic semestral break in October that the Lady Blue Booters join annually, they finished as runner-up. The Finals was a tightly fought game which went into a 10-10 silver goal overtime (full 20 minutes). The final score was 1-0 and the winning goal was scored by their opponent only at the last five minutes of overtime. The following year, the Lady Blue Booters won the championship of the 2013 Philippine National Games held in May 2013.
In Season 75 (2012–13), the Blue Booters topped the elimination round which gave them the top seed in the Final 4 and a twice-to-beat advantage. The Blue Booters did not have to use this advantage as they defeated La Salle, their Final 4 opponent, 4 - 3, in a penalty shoot-out in game one to advance to the Finals for the first time in six years. In the Finals, the Blue Booters swept defending champion UP in their best-of-three series, to win their sixth UAAP championship. Season 75 was a penalty shoot-out season for the Blue Booters. They won all their games in the Final 4 and Finals via penalty shoot-outs.

=== Volleyball ===
The Ateneo Volleyball Program enjoyed a modest success in the NCAA, having won a total of nine championships during a ten-year period from 1967 to 1976. The men's team had two titles and one from the women's, while the juniors team had won six titles. Ateneo dominated NCAA volleyball in the mid-1970s. In 1975, Ateneo had a double championship having won the NCAA volleyball title in the men's and juniors divisions and with the Blue Eaglets making it as three-peat champions. The following year, Ateneo was already considered a collegiate volleyball power as it not only won the 1976 NCAA volleyball title in all three divisions, thus achieving a triple championship but also the Blue Eagles were back-to-back champions and the Blue Eaglets were four-peat champions having won the 1972, 1974, 1975 and 1976 NCAA titles. These titles are considered consecutive because games were suspended in 1973.
In the UAAP, Ateneo has won three championships so far since transferring from the NCAA in 1978. These titles were won by the Lady Blue Spikers in Season 76 (2013–14) and Season 77 (2014–15) and by the Blue Spikers in Season 77 ( 2014–15), finally ending a title drought of more than 30 years in UAAP volleyball. Prior to their championships, the Lady Blue Spikers had six Final Four appearances (Season 70, 72, 73, 74, 75 and 76) with a second seed and twice-to-beat advantage in season 74 and 75. Prior to the Blue Spikers first championship in Season 77 (2014-2015), their best performance have been Finals appearances in season 44 (1981–82), season 76 (2013–14) and season 77 (2014–15). They also had four Final Four appearances in Seasons 71 (2008), 72 (2009) where they were not able to advance to the Finals and Seasons 76 (2013) and 77 (2014). The Blue Eaglet Spikers' best finish has been first runner-up five times. In season 72 (2009), all three Ateneo varsity volleyball teams were in the Final 4. Season 77 (2014) marked the growing success of the Ateneo volleyball program. The men's, women's and boys' volleyball teams all made it to the Finals.
The Lady Blue Spikers ended a 36-year title drought in the UAAP when it won its first ever title in UAAP season 76 (2013–14). This title was a result of the invigorated volleyball program implemented in the mid 2000s. Sherwin Malonzo was appointed head of this new program. In season 71 (2008–09), Roger Gorayeb, a multi-titled coach was hired as head coach of the Lady Spikers. UAAP season 71 also marked the time that Ateneo started to recruit high school players. Five blue-chip high school players (Fille Cainglet, Jem Ferrer, Dzi Gervacio, Gretchen Ho and A Nacachi) were recruited and who were latter dubbed the Fabulous Five by the Ateneo community and fans. Another group, consisting of three high school players, were recruited the following year, season 2009. One of whom was Aerieal Patnongon who stands at 6' 0". Season 2010 was not only another bumper year in recruitment but also an exciting one as Ateneo hit the jackpot when prized-rookie Alyssa Valdez, a hotly-recruited high school volleyball player was among the 5 high school players recruited that year. She was a national youth volleyball team standout dubbed the "Phenom" by the sports press and two-time (back-to-back) MVP in UAAP high school volleyball. Alyssa Valdez would later break the UAAP women's volleyball record in most points scored in a game on her second year of playing in the league. On January 20, 2013, she scored 35 points (31 spikes, 3 blocks and 1 service ace) in the second round elimination game against Adamson. The standing record before her record breaking performance was 33 points set by an Adamson player in February 14, 2009. Ateneo continued to recruit players in season 74 (2011–12). Mary Mae Tajima was recruited from Ateneo de Davao. Standing at 6' 1", she is the women's volleyball team's tallest player ever.
Ateneo has been recruiting groups of five players from time to time over the years. The 2008 batch is referred to as the Fabulous Five or Fab 5 by the Ateneo community and fans. The 2010 and 2013 batches were all members of the Ateneo team that made history by winning Ateneo's first volleyball championship in the UAAP women's volleyball senior division.
In the Shakey's V-League, a summer tournament which the Ateneo Lady Blue Spikers use as a preparation for the UAAP tournament, their mother league, they won their first major championship in thirty-five years when it won the 8th (2011) Shakey's V-League 1st Conference, a pre-UAAP season tournament. In this championship game, the Ateneo player that stood above everybody else was rookie Alyssa Valdez. The 17-year-old prized-recruit made it all possible. Her coach for this tournament, Charo Soriano a former star Lady Blue Spikers herself, had this to say about the prized recruit, "She really pulled it through for us". It was one big and glorious night for Alyssa Valdez and the mighty Ateneo women's volleyball squad.
In UAAP season 74 (2011–12), the Ateneo Lady Blue Spikers ended the elimination round with 11 wins in 14 games, their best elimination round record in 33 seasons in the UAAP. For the first time ever, they were seeded second in the Final 4 with a twice-to-beat advantage. The Lady Blue Spikers did not find it necessary to use this advantage as they beat their opponent, UST, in Game 1 of their Final 4 series. With this win, they advanced for the first time to the Finals and had the defending champion De La Salle as their opponent. La Salle swept the elimination round and thus had a thrice-to-beat advantage in the Finals. This means that they have to win only twice in the Finals while Ateneo had to win three times to clinch the title. The Ateneo Lady Blue Spikers have not won over La Salle in the last four years. This losing streak was broken by the Ateneo Lady Blue Spikers when they won Game 1 of the Finals. This was La Salle's first and only loss of the season. This win put the Finals series on equal terms. Unfortunately, the Ateneo Lady Spikers lost the next two games and their chance for their first UAAP championship. Despite the runner-up finish, Season 74 was considered a good year for the Ateneo Lady Spikers. Aside from the first-time achievements mentioned above, there were several more. For the first time, the Ateneo Lady Blue Spikers beat Adamson and UST twice in a season, had 13 wins in a season, won in the Final 4 stage and had a rookie (Alyssa Valdez) who scored 30 points in one game.
The Ateneo Lady Blue Spikers were able to successfully defend their Shakey's V-League Season 8 1st Conference title, emerging as champions of the 1st Conference of Season 9 held in the summer of 2012. They were undefeated in the preliminary, quarter and semi-final rounds of the tournament. The Ateneo Lady Blue Spikers defeated the UST Golden Tigresses in their Best-of-Three series in the Finals. This made them a back-to-back champion team. Awarded the Finals MVP plum was Alyssa Valdez who scored 31 points (22 Attacks 8 Service Aces 1 Block) in Game 2 of the Finals. She scored a total of 73 points in the Finals series (59 Attacks 11 Service Aces 3 Blocks). The Lady Blue Spikers garnered their second championship of the year 2012 when they won the 2012 Tuguegarao City Open Invitational held in June 24–30, 2012. They did this in dominating fashion. They did not lose a single set on their way to claiming the championship and the Php500,000.00 top prize.
In order to finally get that elusive first championship in the UAAP Women's Volleyball Division, Head Coach Roger Gorayeb changed his recruitment strategy. For Season 75 (2012–13), he recruited only high school players who are college-play ready. Still, the Lady Spikers fell short. They made it to the Finals for the second consecutive year. However, it was a replay of Season 74 as the Ateneo Lady Blue Spikers again faced and were defeated by the De La Salle Lady Spikers in the Finals.
In preparation for UAAP Season 76 (2013–14), Ateneo hired a new coach for its men's volleyball team. The Blue Spikers responded to this change by winning the championship of the first tournament they joined that year, the UAPPY Cup, a preseason summer tournament. They defeated PLDT, a commercial team, in four sets, 25 - 7, 25 - 23, 28 - 30, 25 - 21. Four Blue Spikers garnered individual awards in this tournament, namely Ricci Gonzales as MVP, Rex Intal as Best Blocker, JP Pareja as Best Digger and Ishmel Polvorosa as Best Server.
In UAAP Season 76, the Blue Spikers made it to the Finals after 33 years of absence. Their last Finals appearance was in 1981. Though they did not win the championship, it was a productive season for the Blue Spikers. Three of its players garnered individual awards. Marck Jesus Espejo won both the Rookie of the Year and the Most Valuable Player of the Year awards. This is a first in the history of UAAP men's volleyball. The Best Setter award was garnered by Esmilzo Joner Polvorosa and the Best Receiver award was won by John Paul Pareja.
The Lady Blue Spikers were not as successful. In their first tournament in 2013, the Shakey's V-League 10th Season 1st Conference, they failed to defend their crown as back-to-back defending champions when they lost to NU in the Finals of the tournament. Shortly after the end of the tournament, Roger Gorayeb, Ateneo's head coach of the women's volleyball team since 2008 stepped down in July 2013. In an effort to sustain the gains made by the Lady Blue Spikers under the watch of Gorayeb, Ateneo hired Anusorn "Tai" Bundit as the women's volleyball team trainer in September 2013. Bundit is the coach of the national women's juniors volleyball team of Thailand, a volleyball powerhouse in Asia. Tai Bundit's status was later changed to head coach. The Ateneo Lady Blue Spikers also went to Thailand during their school year 2013-14 semestral break for a more intensive training.
Ateneo wrote history in UAAP Season 76. In March 15, 2014, the Ateneo Lady Blue Spikers won their first championship in the UAAP. It was a historic title. For the third consecutive season, their opponent in the Finals was the De La Salle Lady Spikers. This time they beat La Salle. The Ateneo Lady Blue Spikers, a third-seeded team, completed one of the greatest upsets in league history in beating La Salle which swept all of their fourteen elimination round matches. They ended La Salle's three-year reign as champions and also snapped La Salle's 30-game winning streak since UAAP Season 75 when it beat the latter in the Finals Game 1 of Season 76. They will go down in UAAP history as the first women's volleyball team to have overcome a thrice-to-beat disadvantage in the Finals, a feat achieved by only one other team in the UAAP in another sporting event (when UP swept DLSU in UAAP Season 76 Women's Table Tennis Finals in 3 games). They were the first ever non-top seed varsity team in the UAAP to win the championship through the league's postseason stepladder format. The road to the championship was full of obstacles. They had to win 5 do-or-die matches in the process - starting with 3 in the step-ladder Semifinals (first against fourth-seeded Adamson University Lady Falcons, and then against second-seeded National University Lady Bulldogs which had a twice-to-beat advantage) and 2 in the Finals against defending champion La Salle Lady Spikers. Team captain Alyssa Valdez was the Season and Finals Most Valuable Player, and also became the first ever UAAP athlete to win 4 awards in one season (which included Best Scorer and Best Server awards).
In December 2014, the collegiate women's varsity volleyball team of the Ateneo de Manila University, the Lady Blue Spikers represented the Philippines in the 17th ASEAN University Games in Palembang, South Sumatra, Indonesia. This was the first time that the Philippines was represented in the women's volleyball tournament of the ASEAN University Games. The Lady Blue Spikers won the bronze medal. This is the first medal finish in international women's volleyball competition for the Philippines since winning bronze in the 2005 Southeast Asian Games.
Ateneo continued to write history in UAAP Season 77 (2014–15). The Lady Blue Spikers achieved a first when they swept the elimination round of Season 77, 14-0. This sweep means that the Ateneo Lady Blue Spikers did not allow the La Salle Lady Spikers to win a single game against them in the elimination rounds, a first for the Lady Blue Spikers since UAAP Season 71. This sweep also earned the Lady Blue Spikers an automatic slot to the Finals for the first time with a thrice-to-beat advantage. The Lady Blue Eagles did more than that in UAAP Season 77. They also swept their post season games to become the first team in 11 seasons to complete an unbeaten campaign. Season 77 signaled the beginning of the success of the Ateneo volleyball program. All three varsity volleyball teams (men's, women's and juniors) of Ateneo in the UAAP were in the Finals. The men's volleyball team won a historic first ever championship in Season 77 when it dethroned the two-time defending champion National University, 23-25, 25-23, 25-23, 25-15, in Game 2 of the best-of-three Finals series at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay City. This is the first ever volleyball championship of Ateneo in the UAAP men's (seniors) division since they joined the UAAP in 1978. In the NCAA they won two titles including their last in 1976 under the late coach Pitong Custodio. The women's volleyball team also won its second championship in Season 77 when they swept second-seeded De La Salle University in 2 straight matches (6 straight sets). The sweep achieved a 16-0 season record (elimination rounds to championship round), a first for any UAAP women varsity team in the Final Four era. Ateneo's recruitment program which is a key component of the volleyball program has been successful in recruiting highly prized players. Alyssa Valdez of the Lady Blue Spikers and Marck Jesus Espejo of the Blue Spikers, who were products of this robust recruitment program, were back-to-back (Season 76 and 77) UAAP MVPs, while Rongomaipapa Amy Ahomiro of the Lady Blue Spikers and Esmilzo Joner Polvorosa were named Season 77 UAAP Finals MVPs. Season 77 also marked the first time that Ateneo won double championships in the senior's division of the UAAP volleyball tournaments.

=== Baseball ===
History shows that Ateneo was not a powerhouse in the sport of baseball despite having American Jesuits who were former varsity baseball players in their youth as mentors in school during the previous millennium. In the NCAA after 54 years of participation, the Blue Batters and Blue Eaglet Batters have won only 2 championships each. The Blue Batters won theirs in 1927 and 1965, while the Eaglet Batters won in 1965 and 1968. The number of championships can be counted with one's fingers but the consolation is the double championship in 1965. According to UAAP records, Ateneo which joined the league in 1978 won its first baseball title in Season 75 (2012–13). This was after a 35-year title drought which Ateneo ended in a big way. Ateneo won a double championship. The Blue Batters and the Blue Eaglet Batters won their first UAAP championship in Season 75. The following season, the Blue Batters won again the UAAP men's baseball crown to become back-to-back champions. The Blue Batters made history when they became a three-peat champion in Season 77 (2014–15).
The Ateneo Blue Batters have the longest losing streak in UAAP history. From 1992 to 2001, the team did not win a single UAAP baseball game. Then on January 20, 2002 (UAAP Season 64), the team finally won its first UAAP game after 10 years by beating National University, 16-9. This was a breakout win for the Blue Batters as they never had a winless season in the next 9 years.
UAAP Season 65 (2002–03) saw the Blue Batters improve on its standing by placing 5th with a 2-8 win-loss record, surpassing the previous year record of 1-9 (6th place). UAAP Season 66 (2003–04) was remarkable as Ateneo defeated La Salle for the first time in over 13 years, 9-8. In Season 67 (2004–05), they finished with a 3-7 record to place 4th overall. It would have been the Blue Batters' first Final Four appearance had UST not swept the elimination round and was declared champions of UAAP Season 67.
The Blue Batters' breakout year was UAAP Season 68 (2005–06) when the team finished tied for 2nd place with a 7-3 record, setting the best win-loss record in its UAAP history. Up until 2011-12, this team was considered the strongest team ever assembled in its UAAP baseball history. In UAAP Season 74 (2011–12), the Blue Batters duplicated the win-loss (7-3) record and second-place finish of the Season 68 Blue Batters. They made the Final 4 as the second-seeded team with a twice-to-beat advantage and batted their way into the Finals for the first time in their UAAP history. They ended the season as runner-up after losing to NU in the Finals. In Season 75 (2012–13), Ateneo and NU met again for the championship. This time the Blue Batters got back at NU and won their first UAAP baseball title.
Baseball was introduced as a demonstration sport in the Juniors Division in UAAP Season 74 (2011–12), where Ateneo finished as runner-up. The following season, the Blue Eaglet Batters won its first baseball title in the UAAP. They were awarded the championship title after sweeping the elimination round.
Past UAAP Seasons HighlightsSeason 68 (2005–06)
Thriving on pressure in UAAP Season 68, the Blue Batters won 5 of their games by just 1 run, most of them in come-from-behind fashion. But they also thrashed an opponent, La Salle, in 8 innings, 17-7, in the second game of the season for its first mercy rule victory in more than a decade. The Blue Batters ended the season with a 7-3 record, so far the best in their UAAP history. They became the first Ateneo team in over a decade to beat each UAAP team at least once in a season. They also made history by being the first team to make it to the Final Four.
Ateneo won its first Final Four game in history on February 16, 2006 by defeating UST, 12-5, to set up a do-or-die Game 2. However, Ateneo lost Game 2, 10-5, to end its magical season.
UAAP Season 69 (2006–07)
UAAP Season 69 was a heartbreaking season for the Ateneo Blue Batters as it was found out at the end of the season that star rookie Michael Justine Zialcita, a U.S. citizen, was not able to submit all the required documents for player's eligibility. Thus, he was declared ineligible despite having Filipino parents. A UAAP Board ruling wiped out all of Ateneo's wins that season and forfeited their Final Four slot. Ateneo finished 4th place with a 3-5 record. Despite the 3-1 start in the 1st round, the Blue Batters lost all their 4 games in the 2nd round.
UAAP Season 71 (2008–09)
Season 71 was a rebirth for the Ateneo Blue Batters. The team finished with a 6-4 record, second best in its UAAP history. Had the Adamson Falcons not swept the season, Ateneo would have been 3rd seed in the Final Four. Among the notable games was the high-scoring win against La Salle, where the Blue Batters blasted the Green Archers, 27-14.
UAAP Season 72 (2009–10)
Coming from last year's successful run, the Blue Batters looked forward to another successful campaign in Season 72. However, the team ended with a winless season, going 0-10 for the first time since the 2000-2001 UAAP season. This dismal performance was due to the loss of their starting pitcher to injury in their game 1 of the season.
UAAP Season 74 (2011–12)
In October 2011, the Ateneo Blue Batters flew to Taichung, Taiwan for an intensive 10-day training at the Si Yen Baseball School. The training program followed a strict schedule and consisted of rigorous skills training sessions, two to three times a day.
This training has done the Blue Batters good. The Blue Batters swept the first round of the eliminations in the UAAP Season 74 baseball tournament, going 5-0, a first time in Ateneo baseball. They beat all their opponents in convincing fashion: Adamson 11-5, NU 13-3, UP 14-3 (5 innings), UST 8-1 and La Salle 8-4.
The Blue Batters had established a six-game winning streak when they continued to win into the second round of elimination, beating UP, 10-0. The streak ended when they lost to Adamson and NU in their succeeding games. They eventually ended the elimination round with a 7-3 record. This finish gave them the second seed in the Final 4 with a twice-to-beat advantage and tied the best win-loss record set by the 2005-06 Ateneo baseball team.
Ateneo beat La Salle, 13-4 in 8 innings of a rained-out game of the Final 4, on February 16, 2012 to advance to the UAAP Finals for the first time.
In Game 1 of the Finals against NU in February 23, 2012, Matt Laurel blasted a 3-run home run in the 1st inning to help power Ateneo past NU, 11-4. Unfortunately, the Blue Batters lost the next two games of the Finals series. Game 3 was a heartbreaking one as Ateneo lost 5-4, on centerfielder Kirk Long's error that enabled NU to score the go-ahead run in the top of the 9th. They finished Season 74 as runner-up. However, it was a season that the players consider as historic as some of their accomplishments were first-time achievements of a Blue Batter team.
Game 3 also saw one of the biggest Ateneo crowds in the history of UAAP baseball, since their first Final 4 appearance in Season 68. Among those who attended were not only family and friends of the players, but also their softball counterparts the Lady Batters, fellow students and alumni, including former Blue Batters Atty. Kristian Ablan, Stefano Baltao, Carlo Banzon, Christopher Chua, Nikko Dizer, Paolo Padla, Justin Zialcita and Jonathan Sibal. Sports columnist, TV commentator and Ateneo professor Sev Sarmenta was also there to cheer on the blue and white.
For the first time, UAAP Baseball had TV coverage on ABS-CBN's Studio 23, shown on delayed telecast a week after the Finals.
In recognition of the Blue Batters reaching the Finals for the first time ever in the UAAP, they were presented the 2011-12 Breakthrough Team of the Year Award during the Ateneo Athletes' Recognition and Awards Night held in March 8, 2012.
The Blue Eaglet Batters also set a record in the UAAP Baseball Juniors Division by scoring 26 home runs in 5 innings and at the same time blanking the Batters of the UST Tiger Cubs in a game in January 28, 2012. They also finished as runner-up in the maiden season of Juniors baseball.
UAAP Season 75 (2012–13)
Before the start of the UAAP Season 75 baseball tournament, the Ateneo Blue Batters went again to Taichung, Taiwan during the semestral break of academic year 2012-13, for an intensive training at the Si Yen Baseball School. This training was productive as the Blue Batters swept the first round of the elimination for the second consecutive year, going 5-0. They beat all their opponents in convincing fashion: Adamson 15-3, La Salle 15-7, UP 14-6, UST 11-3 and NU 9-2. The Blue Batters made it to the Finals as the top seeded team with a win-loss record of 8-2, their best finish in the UAAP. In the Finals, the Blue Batters beat defending champion NU in their best-of-three series to win its first UAAP baseball championship after a 35-year title drought. In the deciding game 3 of the Finals best-of-three series, the Blue Batters shut out NU, 4-0. This was a statement made by the Blue Batters that they have not forgotten their last year's loss to NU in the deciding game 3 of the Finals.
The Blue Eaglet Batters also won their first UAAP Juniors Baseball title in Season 75 (2012–13) on February 9, 2013 after sweeping the elimination round.
UAAP Season 76 (2013–14)
After attending their annual preseason training camp in Taichung, Taiwan, the Blue Batters went on to successfully defend their crown in Season 76 (2013–14). They swept no. 1 seed La Salle in their best-of-three Finals series. Pitcher Andy Tan garnered the MVP and Best Pitcher awards. The Rookie of the Year award went to Miguel Dumlao. Mat laurel got three awards, namely: Best Slugger, Most Home Runs and Most Stolen Bases.
UAAP Season 77 (2014–15)
As part of their preseason preparations, the Blue Batters joined the 2014 Hong Kong International Baseball Open ("HKIBO") which ran from December 19–22, 2014. The tournament was sanctioned by the World Baseball Softball Confederation ("WBSC"). Eight teams from Korea, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong participated. The Blue Batters, representing the Philippines swept the Group B elimination round and beat Group A's top seed Hong Kong in the Finals to emerge as champions of this international tournament.
Game scores:
Season 77 is a historic season for Ateneo baseball. The Blue Batters won their third consecutive championship in Season 77. They are now a three-peat champion.

== Sports Development Program ==
In order for the Ateneo varsity teams to excel in sports on a sustained basis, the Ateneo University Athletics Office has implemented an integrated sports development program. It was formulated in the late 1990s to methodically develop sports talent in the Ateneo Grade School, High School, and the Loyola Schools (college). The program has a grassroots approach, building from the ground up. The same methods and principles are used in the Grade School, High School, and Loyola Schools sports programs. Several top players from the grade school and high school have already become successful in the college teams.
Under the integrated sports development program, the University Athletics Office has identified several "priority sports." Initially, these sports were chosen based on what the Ateneo already excelled in as well as available sports facilities. The goal was to expand the list of priority sports each year, with each sport under a program manager. To date, there are 14 programs, each for a UAAP sport: athletics, badminton, baseball/softball, basketball, cheerleading, chess, fencing, football, lawn tennis, table tennis, judo, taekwondo, swimming, and volleyball (indoor and beach). Under the basketball and the football programs are the Ateneo Basketball School and the Ateneo Football Center, which give regular basketball and football clinics to students. The plan is to open centers for the other programs as well. In 2013, clinics for volleyball were held, as a step towards opening a volleyball center. One measure of their success is that other schools are opening similar centers.
The main objective of this sports program is to have a better overall standing in the UAAP general championship. Ateneo has not won a General Championship in the seniors division since it joined the UAAP in 1978. In UAAP Season 75 (2012-13), Ateneo finished third place in the seniors division General Championship. It was the highest standing for Ateneo so far.


== Sports Facilities ==
The sports-loving American Jesuits who took over the administration of the Ateneo de Manila in 1912 and taught at the Ateneo in the 1900s left a legacy in sports to the school. Unlike other schools, Ateneo in the early and mid-1900s, was fortunate to have educators who were former athletes. The American Jesuits were former basketball, baseball and soccer players as well as track and field athletes. They provided the fundamentals of these sports to their students as coaches of the varsity teams. They preached to them the Greek ideal "mens sana in corpore sano" which translates to "a sound mind in a sound body." They believed that sports play an indispensable role in Ateneo's scheme of a well-rounded training as it trains character, strengthens the determination to succeed, inculcates a sense of fairness and charity, cultivates humility and graciousness and complements spiritual exercise. Thus the term student-athlete is a buzzword in the campus. Since sports is an important part of the Ateneo educational system, the Jesuits give importance to the construction of sports facilities. The first building to be built when Ateneo moved its main campus to Loyola Heights from Pade Faura was the Blue Eagle gym. Since then, Ateneo with the generous financial support of wealthy alumni in some projects has spent much in the construction of numerous sports facilities. Here are the various sport facilities found in the Ateneo Loyola Heights campus:
The Blue Eagle Gym

Ateneo is the first school in the Philippines to build a large school gym. The Ateneo gym has a seating capacity of 7,500. School gyms in the 1940s were small because their primary purpose was as a practice facility for the school's varsity basketball team and a place for student convocations as a secondary usage. Fr. William F. Masterson, S.J., then the Ateneo Rector had a different concept in mind. He wanted more usage for the gym he envisioned, one that is designed to be revenue generating and home to various varsity teams. Specifically, it was to be an alternate venue to the Rizal Memorial Coliseum for the National Collegiate Athletic Association games. Thus the gym that was constructed stands 213 feet wide and 281 feet long (or 60,863 square feet) and cost Php 650,000.00 to construct. The gym is not only the home of the Blue Eagles and Lady Eagles (college varsity basketball teams) but also of the college baseball, chess, fencing, judo, table tennis and volleyball varsity teams. It is the practice facility of these varsity teams. There is a baseball batting cage, a chess room, a fencing strip and a judo training area. The basketball court is converted to a volleyball court when the volleyball varsity teams practice. The Blue Babble Battalion and band use the gym for their practice. It is also used by the University community for big gatherings. The gym houses the University Athletics Office, a sports library, a study hall, a small air-conditioned dormitory and an exhibit room for the multi-titled Ateneo Blue Eagle Coach Baby Dalupan. There is also a room for trophies, awards and sports memorabilia. Locker and shower rooms are available for the players.
The gym was inaugurated on December 3, 1949 and has undergone several name changes during its lifetime. At its christening in 1949, it was called the Ateneo Gym. In the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, the gym was leased to Emerito Ramos, Sr., an alumnus (HS '25) and was renamed the Loyola Center. With this change in management, the gym was used not only as practice facility of the school's varsity basketball teams and for NCAA basketball games but also as an entertainment venue. Musical concerts were held. Shows of local and American rock-n-roll singer artists were presented at the gym, making it a veritable mini- Araneta Coliseum. The name Loyola Center stuck even after management was reverted to the school when the lease contract expired. It was in the year 2000, when the gym was undergoing renovation, that it got its present name, the Blue Eagle Gym.
The Ateneo Blue Eagle gym is a landmark due to the large blue eagle emblem mounted on the facade that can be easily seen from the main public road (Katipunan Avenue) along the front of the school campus.
The Moro Lorenzo Sports Center
The Moro Lorenzo Sports Center is a sports complex built in the Loyola Heights campus to bolster the sports program of Ateneo. Construction of the sports center was started in November 11, 2000 and was fully completed in 2001. It was inaugurated on March 17, 2001 and named after one of Ateneo's basketball players, Luis "Moro" Lorenzo, who played for the Blue Eagles in the 1940s. The sports complex offers facilities such as an indoor basketball court where the university's varsity basketball teams hold their practice, indoor badminton and volleyball courts, indoor track oval measuring approximately 200 meters, a weights room and a fully air-conditioned sports medical clinic. Other facilities include an audio-visual room, locker rooms and Prayer Room.
The Moro Lorenzo Football Field
A new 40 million-peso football field was constructed at the Ateneo Loyola campus grounds. Construction started on August 22, 2011 and was finished on December 2012, in time for the opening of the UAAP football season 75. The University Athletics Office (UAO) and the Luis "Moro" Lorenzo family, as sponsor, have partnered to transform the present Erenchun Football Field into a world-class football pitch which was officially named the Moro Lorenzo Football Field. This football field meets international and Olympic standards. According to the standards set by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), the minimum acceptable size for a football field is 90 by 45 meters, while the maximum size is set at 120 by 90 meters. Based on these prescribed sizes, the Moro Lorenzo Football Field which is 110 by 70 meter pitch meets world-class standards.
The pitch is an all-weather field composed of first-generation Princess 77 Bermuda grass imported from Thailand because later-generation grass tends to discolor as it is of lower quality. The Princess 77 is a low maintenance variant similar to those used in golf courses in Hawaii. A grass nursery was built nearby which is being used to plant more Bermuda grass to be used for replacing dead spots on the pitch over time. The pitch has drainage and sprinkler systems similar to golf courses to maintain the conditions of the field. The University Athletics Office stressed that it is the first field of its kind in Ateneo so it has to be of high quality. The UAO has also been working with the United States-based Trans-Lux Corporation for an outdoor weatherproof 5 by 4 meter electronic scoreboard with LED lights for the football games. According to the UAO, this will be the first scoreboard of its kind in the Philippines. Floodlights were installed over the renovated field so that football games can be held at night.
The Loyola Schools Blue Track Oval
A new track oval has been built around the Moro Lorenzo football field. Both sports facilities are situated on the same place where the old cinder track oval and Erenchun Football Field were located. Work started in late 2011 and finished in May 2013. It is 400 meters long with eight lanes. The oval meets the standards set by the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) which stipulates that an Olympic-standard race track be at least 400 meters long and have at least four lanes. The actual oval features the Herculean Spike Resistant Sprint system imported from the Netherlands that cost roughly P19 million, a variant that is accepted by the IAAF. It is water impermeable and spike resistant. The oval is colored royal blue. The track oval will be used primarily by the Track and Field varsity teams which are presently training off-campus. Other Ateneo varsity teams will be using the track oval for their training activities which require running. It may also become a venue for UAAP Track and Field tournaments in the future.
The Loyola Schools Sand Court
A new beach volleyball sand court has been built near the Moro Lorenzo football field. The court was opened for use last May 2014. It is not a regular court but a makeshift type, good enough for practice purposes. It is being used by the Beach Volleyball varsity teams so that they do not have to go off-campus for practice.
The Loyola Schools Swimming Pool
The Loyola Schools swimming pool is a state-of-the-art short-course pool used for PE swimming classes and by the varsity swimming teams for training and dual meets. It is a 25-meter, 8-lane, roofed and no-wave swimming pool and complemented by a bleachers section for 250 spectators and outside showers. A Php5 million donation from a former member of the Ateneo varsity swimming team, alumnus Cecilio Pedro, BS '75, helped cover part of the Php15 million cost of the sports facility that Ateneo never had since joining the NCAA and UAAP in 1924 and 1978, respectively. Construction was completed on June 28, 2006. The blessing and inauguration was held in July 15, 2006.
The Loyola Schools Physical Education Dept. Sports Complex
The Loyola Schools P.E. Dept. sports complex consists of the College Covered (basketball) Courts, two lawn tennis courts, table tennis courts, dancing hall, martial arts gym, a bodybuilding gym, dressing and shower rooms, a half-Olympic swimming pool that is used by both P.E. swimming classes and the varsity swimming teams for training and dual meets and a shooting range used by the rifle and pistol varsity team, the first of its kind in the Philippines. Also in the same complex are the College Athletics office and the offices of the physical education department and a cafeteria.
The Loyola Schools Covered Courts
The Loyola Schools (College) Covered Courts is a sports facility which is part of the Loyola Schools Physical Education Department sports complex. It consists of eight regulation-sized basketball courts which have concrete floors that can be converted to a futsal court and/or volleyball courts. It also has dressing and shower rooms. It was opened for student-use in 1951.


== Sports Traditions ==
The Ateneo has rich traditions in things that are related to sports. Most of these traditions have been started by the sports-loving American Jesuits after they took over the administration of Ateneo in 1912. However, the sports related traditions that the American Jesuits introduced in the Ateneo were not original ideas but copied from American schools. Team mascot, pep band, organized cheering, cheerleaders and bonfires were all American sports innovations.
Cheering
The Blue Babble Battalion
Cheering by Ateneo students during games against other schools existed as early as 1914 when Ateneo started to participate in intercollegiate sports. But it was more of an individual or a small group in the Ateneo gallery shouting spontaneous encouragements to the Blue and White team or heckling the opponents. There were no cheerleaders to lead the whole Ateneo gallery to cheer in unison with prepared cheers so as to produce loud and solid-volume cheerings.
Ateneo was the first school to field an organized cheering squad in the Philippines. Inspired by how American colleges made use of organized cheering to bolster their teams' morale, Fr. Austin Dowd, S.J introduced this organized cheering form to the Philippines. He recruited the first three cheerleaders of Ateneo, namely, Leon Ma. "Rah-jah" Guerrero HS '31 AB '35, "Crown Prince" Elpediforo Cuna HS '30 AB '34 and Jumpin' Jess Paredes HS '31 AB '35. During those early years, there were only three cheerleaders each NCAA season and they were fondly called the "Princes of Personality". The name Blue Babble Battalion came much later. There is no official record in Ateneo history when this name was introduced. Ateneo alumni old-timers only recall that this name was already in use in the 1950s. However, cheerleader Jesse Paredes, HS '54 AB '58 (son of one of the pioneer cheerleaders of Ateneo, Jess Paredes), clarified that "the Blue Babble Battalion was the Ateneo gallery, not the cheerleaders. That is why it is a battalion". In the 1940s up to the 1980s, The Ateneo gallery that is called the Blue Babble Battalion referred to the Ateneo spectators in the bleachers section of the coliseum or gym because almost all of the Ateneo gallery was seated there. It was composed mostly of high school students, some Jesuit scholastics and faculty. All of the cheerleaders and the pep band were also there. According to the alumni of the 1950s, one of the reasons they watched from the bleachers section was that they were given a 50% discount if they bought their bleachers tickets for NCAA games at the school cashier's office. They paid only fifty centavos for a one Peso ticket. This preference for the bleachers section changed when the UAAP games started to be held regularly at the Araneta Coliseum in the 2000s. Ateneo students watched the games from both the bleachers and upper box sections of the coliseum, resulting in cheerleaders being thinly spread over a wider area. The Jesuits and faculty deserted totally the bleachers section and watched the games from the lower sections of the coliseum. This reference to the Ateneo gallery as the Blue Babble Battalion was lost over time. Alumni old-timers point to the demographic changes in the Ateneo gallery as one of the causes for this loss. The once solid Ateneo gallery in the bleachers is now dispersed and even mixed with the crowd of the opposing school.
The Sixth Man
The name Blue Babble Battalion would be resurrected later but as the name of a student organization. The Ateneo cheerleaders, cheerdancers, cheerlifters and pep band grouped themselves together under the name Blue Babble Battalion. With the loss of this name to the cheerleaders, the Ateneo community started to call the Ateneo gallery as the Sixth Man (in a basketball game). Sports articles published by the school and Guidon, the official student newspaper of Ateneo, showed that up to the 1980s there were references to the Ateneo gallery as the Blue Babble Battalion, and the name Sixth Man started to appear in sports articles as early as the year 2000.
Ateneo Cheers, Yells and Songs
Ateneo's cheering tradition consists of cheers, yells and songs that imbibed the Ateneo spirit. They added much to the clapping of hands and stomping of feet by inspiring and willing the school varsity teams to victory time and again. There are no records of when and who wrote the Ateneo's cheers and yells. The cheers are said to have been inspired by Roman traditions. Contrary to popular belief, the cheers themselves have no literal meaning such as Fabilioh and Halikinu, which some mistake for Greek or Latin words. They are just letters put together and have a rhythmic sound. The yells of Ateneo are one to three words of encouragement such as "Fight", "Animo Ateneo" and "Get that ball". The Ateneo songs are the opposite of the cheers. They are all intelligible and the composers of some of them are known. After the eagle was officially chosen as the school's mascot, the fight song, "Blue Eagle - The King" was composed by Raul Manglapus (AB '39) in the summer of 1939. The marching song, "Cheer, cheer and Go!" was composed by Lamberto Avellana (AB '37). Some songs like "Hail! Ateneo Hail!" and the Ateneo Cadet Corps March were adopted and modified from cheer songs of American Jesuit schools, such as Fordham. The music were borrowed and new lyrics were written or the proper names were just changed. A cheerbook, titled On Wings Of Blue was published in the 1930s and reprinted in the 1950s and 1987. This first edition contains all the songs, cheers and notes compiled from since the cheering tradition began before the foundation of the NCAA. This small blue booklet featured as well, interesting tidbits about things Atenean such as the colors, shield, motto and the mascot of the school. The 1998 edition has gone through some revisions, including the addition of the Song for Mary.
Ateneo Cheer Rallies
No article has been found so far to establish when Ateneo's historic tradition of cheer rallies started. Alumni old-timers can only remember that they participated in cheer rallies in the 1950s. Cheer rallies were not continuously held. There were periods of several years when the tradition was dormant. The cheer rallies of yesteryears and of today are a lot different in terms of participants and purpose. In the former, only high school students participated while the whole University and alumni participated in the latter. The cheer rallies of earlier years were held to teach and practice the cheers. Today's cheer rallies' main purpose is as a send-off to all the University varsity athletes as they embark on their journey to the battlefield of sports.
Cheer Rallies of Yesteryears
In the 1950s and 1960s, cheer rallies were held in early June in preparation for the opening of the NCAA season. The cheer rallies were held in the high school covered courts and attended only by the high school students. After the flag ceremony on a Monday morning, classes were suspended for one period to hold the cheer rally which was led by the college cheerleaders. The high school student population was divided into eight groups. Each group was composed of a mixture of 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students. Each group would yell the same cheer. There were eight pennants each with an image of different bird species attached to poles. The group that cheered the loudest got the pennant with the image of the eagle, and the group with the lowest noise volume was given the pennant with the image of the crow. Seldom used cheers were practised and the juniors and seniors basketball varsity teams were paraded on the stage. The team captain (King Eagle) of the seniors basketball team gave a short pep talk to the gathered students, promising the school to do their best to win the championship and asking the students to support the team by attending the games.
Cheer Rallies of Today
Today's cheer rallies are big production events. It even has a name, the Big Blue Eagle Cheer Rally. They have a festive atmosphere. Held at the Blue Eagle gym, there are musical performances by Atenean music bands and video presentations of notable moments of previous season's campaign. Demonstration squads from different sports like volleyball, taekwondo and judo show their techniques on the hardwood. The Blue Babble Battalion is next as the cheerleders lead the crowd in cheering while the cheerdancers perform their cheering moves. The last part of the event is a basketball game between the current Blue Eagle team and an alumni Blue Eagle team. The top officials of the University are in attendance. The university president, vice-presidents and Directors of various school units are present. They are joined by the alumni. It is a University-wide affair. The crowd is composed of students from the grade school, high school and college. All the varsity athletes from said school departments are paraded before the crowd. The affair is ended with an inspirational talk by the university president who wishes the athletes success in their respective campaigns. Finally the crowd sings the Song for Mary.
The Blue Bonfire
Just as the Romans welcomed home their victorious army with a big celebration, so does the Ateneo community welcome home their victorious athletes with a celebratory bonfire. Whenever the men's or women's varsity basketball team win a UAAP championship, a bonfire is held in October. This traditional celebration fetes not only the Blue Eagles and the Lady Eagles, but also all the other varsity teams that won championships during the first semester of the UAAP season. Students, alumni, family members and friends of Ateneans, as well as die-hard fans attend the event to cheer their favorite athletes and to have their picture taken with them in front of the bonfire. They also ask the players to autograph their Ateneo shirt, ball, slam book, magazine featuring their favorite player or other belongings. All the players and coaches are formally presented to the crowd by asking them to go up the stage where some of them give short talks. The program emcees ask questions from the team which answers the crowd are interested to hear. There are many food booths to choose from and local bands to entertain. This celebratory bonfire is the culmination of the school's first semester sports season which started earlier in July with a cheer rally. A second bonfire is held in March to celebrate championships won in the second semester.
This bonfire tradition dates back to 1932 or possibly even earlier when the Blue Eagles won their first NCAA championship in 1928. The 1932 bonfire was held in the Luneta Park.


== College Athletics Office ==
The phrase Sports are Us essentially defines the area of responsibility of the College Athletics Office. It is a service bureau that supports college varsity teams by offering services such as issuing certificates, facilitating early registration and changes in class schedules, procuring extra accident insurance, facilitating P.E. and NSTP exemptions and scholarships, sourcing varsity jackets, and handling team budgets. To do all this, the office works with various offices in the Loyola Schools such as the Registrar’s Office and the Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. When needed, they also coordinate with the Office of Admission and Aid and the University Athletics Office to provide tutorials to athletes with special academic needs since in the Ateneo, student athletes are really students.
The College Athletics Office also works with student writers and the Ateneo Sports Shooters(www.fabilioh. com). Supervising the Athletics Council is another important aspect of the office’s work. Through the AC, the school is able to keep an ear open to hear athletes’ concerns, and the office in turn raises these concerns to the Loyola Schools administration for proper action.


== Athletes Recognition Awards ==
Ateneo formally recognizes the best of its athletes annually. The Loyola Schools has its Athletes' Recognition and Awards Night which is held every month of March. Athletes, coaches and team managers of the school's varsity teams attend this awarding ceremony. The first Athletes' Night was held in February 19, 1997, although some of the awards predate this event. The awards given out are the Ambrosio Padilla Student-Athlete of the Year, Study Hall Student-Athlete of the Year, the Guidon-Moro Lorenzo Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year, Blue Eagle and Lady Eagle of the Year, Step-up Athlete of the Year, the X Factor Athlete of the Year, Team Manager of the Year and the Breakthrough Team of the Year. Below is a list (incomplete) of student-athletes who received these awards:

== The Student-Athletes ==
Ateneo is one of the schools in the Philippines where one will find true student-athletes. It is a school whose academic standard is the same for all its students, athletes and non-athletes. This policy has resulted in not a few athletes being dropped from enrolment by the school. On the other hand, the same policy has challenged some of the athletes to excel in both academics and sports. They graduated with Latin honors. Here are some of the student-athletes who excelled in both academics and sports:
Ambrosio "Paddy" Padilla, HS '26 AB '30 (Summa cum laude) - King Eagle, 1928 NCAA champion Ateneo Blue Eagles team; King Eagle, 1929 NCAA defending champion Ateneo Blue Eagles team; Star player of the 1926-1929 Ateneo Blue Eagles teams who was the highest individual scorer in NCAA Season 6 (1929–30) by scoring 29 points in one game.
Carolyn Tan-Chi, BS '06 (Summa cum laude) - 2002 UAAP Rookie of the Year; Awardee, 2002 UAAP Athlete-Scholar Award; Member 2005 Ateneo Lady Eagles team, champions: UAAP Season 68, 59th NCR Intercollegiate Basketball Championships, 2005 National Intercollegiate Basketball Championships and 2005 Home and Away Invitational League; 2005 and 2006 Ateneo <Ambrosio Padilla> Student-Athlete of the Year; Member, 2004-2006 National Honor Society; Awardee, 2005 Procter & Gamble Student Excellence Award; 2006 St. Ignatius Most Outstanding Scholar.
Christopher John "Chris" Tiu, BS '09 (Cum Laude) - 2006 UAAP Comeback Player; Selected, 2007 and 2008 UAAP Mythical 5; King Eagle, 2008 UAAP Champion Ateneo Blue Eagles team; Garnered, 2008 UAAP Maasahan Award; 2008 Ateneo <Moro Lorenzo> Sportsman of the Year.


== The Blue Phenomenons ==
The moniker "Phenom" was first used by Jamike Jarin, the high school varsity basketball coach of Ateneo in the late 2000s to describe one of his players. The moniker caught the attention of the sports press and Ateneo fans who then started to also call other outstanding student athletes of Ateneo as phenomenons or "phenoms". These athletes earned this moniker because they had outstanding athletic careers in their chosen field of sports in high school. They were team captains, UAAP MVPs and members of their school's champion UAAP high school varsity team. In collegiate varsity, they were all in the starting line-up in their rookie year. To date, there are three Ateneo student athletes who have been dubbed as "Phenoms":
Kiefer Isaac Ravena, GS 2007 HS 2011 BS Candidate 2015 - Basketball
Michael Jeremy "Mikko" Mabanag, HS 2011 BS Candidate 2015 - Football
Alyssa "Aly" Valdez, AB Candidate 2014 - Volleyball


== Sibling teammates ==
There have been instances when brothers or sisters were/are teammates. Below is an incomplete list of sibling teammates in various varsity teams:


== The King Eagle ==
In the late 1950s, the sports press started referring to the team captain of the Ateneo men's varsity basketball team as the King Eagle. The sports scribes got this name from the school's fight song, Blue Eagle - The King, which they hear being sang by the Ateneo gallery during the games when the Blue Eagles were still playing in the NCAA. Edgardo "Ed" Ocampo of the back-to-back 1957 and 1958 NCAA champions Ateneo Blue Eagle team was the first team captain to be called King Eagle by the press. Here is a partial list of the Ateneo men's varsity basketball team King Eagles.

== The Blue Olympians ==
The Ateneo Blue Eagles have contributed eight basketball players to the Philippine national teams to the Olympics during the years from 1936 to 1972. During this 37-year period, the Olympics was held eight times but Philippine basketball participated only in seven of the eight. The Philippines did not qualify in 1964. While the Blue Eagles did not actually contribute players to each of the seven Olympic events during said period, their contribution roughly comes out to an average of one player per Olympic event without counting thrice Ed Ocampo who was selected to play in three Olympic stagings. The Blue Eagles could have given more players to the national cause if not for the Philippines not qualifying or participating in the basketball event after the 1972 Olympics . Here are the names of the "Blue Olympians".

== Hall of Fame ==
The Ateneo Sports Hall of Fame is where the victories and memories of Ateneo athletic heroes of yesteryears are forever enshrined so that the Atenean may know his heritage, that he may cherish it, take pride in it and preserve it; that he may pass it on to those that follow in the noble lineage of Loyola; that the whole world may know; that the old Atenean may relive the glories of the past, and the young Atenean may have a spring whence to draw inspiration.
In 1978, a committee of the Ateneo Alumni Association composed of some hard-core alumni and headed by Naning Yengko, AB '38 made the dream of an Ateneo Sports Hall of Fame (ASHOF) come true. The first induction of the ASHOF was held in 1979 at the Manila Hotel where Ambrosio Padilla (HS '26 AB '30), Moro Lorenzo (HS '47 AB '51) and thirteen other Ateneo great athletes were inducted.
The second induction included basketball greats Frankie Rabat and Ed Ocampo. There were also great coaches, namely, Louie Javellana, Ted Erenchun and Baby Dalupan whose nominations to the Hall of Fame were easily approved.
Starting with the 1988 Induction, selection of new inductees were more structured and organized. The 2000 Induction saw the ASHOF moving to its new home at the north end of the Moro Lorenzo Sports Complex. Here, the relics, memorabilia, pictures and trophies of great athletes and teams can be viewed.
