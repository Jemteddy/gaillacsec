Tami Steinmetz Center For Peace Research is an academic research institution of Tel Aviv University which surveys public opinion regarding the peace process, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The center publishes monthly surveys about the current state of public opinion. It is most famous for the "Peace Index", a numerical measure of Israeli public support for the peace process. The Peace Index is divided into 4 sub-indices:
General Peace Index.
Oslo Index.
Syrian Index.
Negotiation Index.
Each index is computed according to the number and percent of supporters for each peace negotiation and the number of people believing that the negotiation will actually achieve peace.
