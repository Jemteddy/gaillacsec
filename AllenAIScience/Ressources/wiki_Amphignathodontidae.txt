The marsupial frogs are a disputed family (Amphignathodontidae) in the order Anura. Where it is treated as a separate family, it consists of two genera, Gastrotheca, and Flectonotus. These frogs are native to Neotropical America (Central and South America). Under currently dominating view, these are treated as part of family Hemiphractidae.
