The Polynesian storm petrel (Nesofregetta fuliginosa) is a species of seabird in the Hydrobatidae family. It is placed in the monotypic genus Nesofregetta.
Markedly polymorphic, several subspecies were described, and light birds were even considered a species on their own (white-throated storm-petrel). Not even subspecies are generally accepted today however.
It is found in Chile, French Polynesia, Kiribati, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, possibly American Samoa, possibly Fiji, and possibly Samoa.
Its natural habitats are open seas, rocky shores, and sandy shores. It is threatened by introduced predators in its nesting areas.
