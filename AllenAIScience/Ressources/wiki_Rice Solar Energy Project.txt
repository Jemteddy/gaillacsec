The Rice Solar Energy Project is a 150 MW concentrating solar power facility project to be developed in Riverside County, California, the United States. Proposed by Rice Solar, a subsidiary of SolarReserve, the thermal power tower facility will be located on 1,410 acres (570 ha) of private land on the site of the former Rice Army Airfield, near the abandoned town of Rice, California. The project's innovative molten salt storage system will capture solar energy and deliver power to the grid even after the sun goes down. The facility is "expected to power 68,000 homes, create up to 450 construction jobs, and generate more than $48 million in state and local tax revenue over the first 10 years of operation".

The project is developed by Rice Solar Energy, LLC, a subsidiary of SolarReserve, LLC. The facility will consist of about 17,000 heliostats focused onto a central receiver tower with an overall height of 653 feet (199 m), and an integrated thermal storage system, which uses molten salt, a mixture of sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate, as heat carrier. The power plant will be located on 1,410 acres (570 ha) of previously disturbed private land.
The project has undergone extensive environmental review and has mitigated potential environmental impacts. SolarReserve will fund the acquisition and enhancement of 1,522 acres (616 ha) to compensate for impacts to desert tortoise habitat on private and public land.
In December 2011, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar approved a transmission line, access road and substation on public lands that will connect the Rice project to the power grid in California.
In January 2013, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved SolarReserve's amended 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E).
