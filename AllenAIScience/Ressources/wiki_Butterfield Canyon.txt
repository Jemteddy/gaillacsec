Butterfield Canyon is a canyon in Salt Lake County, Utah. It is just west of the city of Herriman. There is a Butterfield Canyon Elementary School near the canyon.
Butterfield Canyon contains a paved road (with the exception of a 1/4 mile portion on the Tooele side that is well maintained dirt) that connects Tooele with Herriman. Butterfield Canyon road climbs to a summit of 9,180 ft. above sea level. At night the mouth of the canyon is a dangerous area as large herds of deer move into the farmlands for feeding.
