== Reception ==


=== Reviews ===
Writing in The New York Times, Gerald Jonas gave the collection a scathing review, saying that the stories "reveal Bradbury at his worst -- dressing up the sentimental cliches of mass magazine fiction in various s.f. or fantasy disguises." Jonas noted that Long After Midnight contained little recent work, but was mostly decades-old fiction passed over when compiling prior collections. Associated Press books editor Phil Thomas, however, praised the collection as "filled with the sense of wonder that marks so much of Bradbury's work."


=== Awards ===
It was nominated for the 1977 World Fantasy Awards category of "Best Collection/Anthology".


== Adaptations ==


=== Television miniseries ===

In 1979 NBC partnered with the BBC to commission The Martian Chronicles, a three-episode miniseries adaptation running just over four hours. It was written by Richard Matheson and was directed by Michael Anderson. The story "The Messiah" was incorporated into the mini-series and rewritten to be part of "The Martian" segment.


=== Television adaptations of individual stories ===
The cable television series The Ray Bradbury Theater adapted two individual short stories from Long After Midnight, "The Utterly Perfectly Murder" and "Punishment Without Crime". The 1985 The Twilight Zone revival adapted one short story from Long After Midnight, "The Burning Man".
