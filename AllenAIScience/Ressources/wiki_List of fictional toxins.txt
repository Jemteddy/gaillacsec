This is a list of toxins, poisons, chemical weapons and biological weapons from works of fiction (usually in fantasy and science fiction). The toxins are divided into three alphabetical groups: fictional poisons, fictional chemical and biological weapons, and fictional mutagens.


== Fictional poisons ==
This is the list for fictional poisons, the toxins that are used to hurt or kill on an individual scale.


== Fictional chemical/biological weapons ==
This is the list of fictional chemical weapons. Fictional chemical weapons are toxins that are used on large scale, by either military, paramilitary or terrorist organizations.


== Fictional mutagens ==
While real-world mutagens produce genetic alterations, or mutations, fictional substances often produce sudden, visible changes in the morphology of organisms. The list below therefore includes fictional substances that produce such effects, as well as more plausible mutagens.
