Super Friends is American animated series about a team of superheroes which ran from 1973 to 1986 on ABC. In the 1990s, the show was being shown on Cartoon Network and more recently its sister channel, Boomerang. It is based on the Justice League and associated comic book characters published by DC Comics.
Each episode was 44 minutes long. After the third season, it was reduced to 22 minutes and ever so often expanded cast of characters by featuring other JLA heroes joining the main five Super Friends (Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Batman and Robin) on a semi-regular basis. The series episodes varied from single episode stand-alone stories to episodes with two, three, or even four segments.
The varied incarnations of the group, from Super Friends (1973–1974) through The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians (1985–1986), were considered by their creators to be one series. There were a total of 109 episodes, along with two episodes of The New Scooby-Doo Movies, with Batman and Robin appearing in "The Dynamic Scooby Doo Affair" and "The Caped Crusader Caper."

This series didn't air during a regularly scheduled Saturday morning time-slot, but did get aired when the series began to get aired in repeats/reruns on other networks. Interesting side note: In prior series, The Wonder Twins were only paired up with Batman & Robin or Wonder Woman. This series found them teaming up with other Justice Leaguers. In "Roller Coaster" they're paired with Atom. In "Two Gleeks" they're paired with Wonder Woman and Green Lantern. In "Unexpected Treasure" they're paired with Hawkman & Hawkgirl. In "Space Racers" they're paired with Wonder Woman & Flash.
