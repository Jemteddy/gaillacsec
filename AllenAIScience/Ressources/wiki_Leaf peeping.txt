Leaf peeping is an informal term for people who travel to view and photograph the fall foliage in areas where foliage changes colors, particularly New England. The origin of the term "leaf peeping" is not well known. A similar custom in Japan is called momijigari.
The term "leaf peeper" is used both with appreciation (for those businesses that benefit from the millions that pour into New England each fall) and with disdain (from those who have to use the roads that are popular with leaf peepers). Hobbyists who get together for leaf peeping commonly refer to their gatherings as Leaf Peepshows.
