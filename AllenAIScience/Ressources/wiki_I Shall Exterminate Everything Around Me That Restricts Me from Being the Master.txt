== Trivia ==
The title of the album comes from a 1921 drawing by George Grosz, which depicts "a grotesque portrayal of a gloating capitalist with a porcine nozzle and cigar smoldering".
The album artwork is taken from a painting called The Long Arm of the Law by Detroit artist Ron Zakrin, who was also behind the artwork for the band's follow-up album Flashy.
The song "Kukuxumushu" (or Kukuxumusu) is Basque for "Flea's Kiss". Kukuxumusu is also a Spanish clothing brand. Tyler Spencer wrote the song after seeing a Kukuxumusu clothing shop whilst on tour and deciding that he liked the word and wanted to use it.
