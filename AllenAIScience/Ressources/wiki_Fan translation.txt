Fan translation refers to the unofficial translation of various forms of media made by fans (Fan labor), usually into a language in which an official translated version is not available.


== Media ==
Notable areas of fan translation include:
Fansubbing – translating and subtitling movies, television programs and other similar media. For many languages, the most popular fan subtitling is of Hollywood movies and American TV dramas, while fansubs into English are largely of East Asian entertainment, particularly anime and tokusatsu.
Fan translation (video gaming) – this practice grew with the rise of video game console emulation in the late 1990s and still mainly focuses on older classic games. These translations are typically distributed as unofficial patches that modify the binary files of the original game into new binaries.
Scanlation – the distribution of fan translated comics, especially manga, as computer images which have been scanned and translated by fans. An alternative method of distributing fan-translated sequential art is to distribute only the translated text, requiring readers to purchase a copy of the work in the original language.
Fan translation of written fiction, particularly short stories but sometimes including full novels.
