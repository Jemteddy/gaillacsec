== Scientific achievements ==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, V.V. Zyuganov formulated the concept of freshwater pearl mussel–—Atlantic salmon symbiosis.
In the 1990s, V.V. Zyuganov and colleagues developed a number of biotechnologies for breeding rare and endangered species of freshwater mussels of a genus of Margaritifera, which are included in the IUCN Red List of the USSR. These inventions are protected inventor's certificates.

In the 1990s, V.V. Zyuganov, in the framework of the concept: - a freshwater pearl mussel - Atlantic salmon symbiosis, put forward the parasite-gooder hypothesis, which prolongs the life-span of the host. This hypothesis is supported by a number of known researchers. The debate has moved beyond the scientific community of Russia. The Zyuganov hypothesis was discussed at international conferences and was cited in scholarly journals and monographs of known researchers.  The tone of the debate was relented after having been discovered similar facts of a life extension of a host by means of parasite in pairs: - parasitic worms - fish and crustacean - fish. For the Zyuganov hypothesis were appeared credible proponents and opponents

V.V. Zyuganov received worldwide reputation after he discovered the fact of a negligible senescence and determined the maximum lifespan (210–250 years) of the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera). The data of V.V. Zyuganov have been confirmed by the Finnish malacologists and gained general acceptance. In general, the V.V. Zyuganov is the author of 120 scientific papers, 6 monographs, and patents.
Zyuganov is known as the author of antineoplastic drugs "Elixir Arctic +" and as the author of publications in popular scientific literature about human aging.
Zyuganov is the president of the international "Society Conservation Margaritiferidae" (SCM). A new society was formed at the Twelfth International Malacological Congress in Vigo, Spain in September 1995 to promote the conservation and management of margaritiferid species around the world. The freshwater pearlshells of the family Margaritiferidae include 25 nominal genera that inhabit rivers of North America and Eurasia, with some species and many populations in imminent danger of extinction or extirpation, respectively. The SCM was formed by a multinational cadre of scientists for the purpose of coordinating international efforts for research, management, and the protection of habitats critical to these species. One of the long-term goals of SCM is to create an international monograph on the systematics, distribution, ecology, and status of margaritiferids globally.
Since 1992, V.V. Zyuganov is supervisor the Salmon wildlife preserve of Varzuga.
V.V. Zyuganov was repeatedly elected a member and chairman of the Far East of the Ministry of Natural Resources of Russia, which examines allowable catches of Pacific salmon.


== Scientific activity ==
Zyuganov studied the evolution of marine and freshwater fauna, ecological and physiological basis of animal and human longevity. He was the supervisor and member of environmental projects in Russia, Germany, Spain, France, Britain, Norway and Sweden. Zyuganov investigated non-aging aquatic organisms in the laboratory and in 70 expeditions in Russia, the United States, 20 countries in Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia on the coast of the Pacific and Indian oceans. Recently, Zyuganov has focused on studying the negligible senescence phenomenon. He shows himself as an apologist of the astrocytic hypothesis of aging of mammals in polemics with opponents.
