Mie celor (meaning: celor noodle), is a noodle dish served in coconut milk soup and shrimp-based broth, specialty of Palembang city, South Sumatra, Indonesia.


== IngredientsEdit ==
It is made from rather large yellow wheat noodle, with the size similar of Japanese buckwheat noodle. The broth can be made from ebi (dried shrimp) or fresh shrimp, cooked in rich coconut milk. The noodle is served with bean sprouts and hard boiled egg, and sprinkled with sliced fresh celery, scallion and fried shallot.
If the broth was made from some fresh shrimps, the peeled shrimp itself would be the part of the topping. If however dried shrimp are used instead, the ground dried shrimp powder would be sprinkled on top of the noodle. To add spiciness, a separate sambal might be added on the side.


== EtymologyEdit ==
In local South Sumatran Malay dialect, celor or celur means showering the ingredients in boiled hot water, in similar fashion as blanching. It refer to the method of softening and cooking the noodle before simmered in coconut milk soup. Today, together with pempek, mie celor has become Palembang's signature dish.
