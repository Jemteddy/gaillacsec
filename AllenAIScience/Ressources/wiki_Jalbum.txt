Jalbum consists of shareware cross-platform software for managing and creating digital photo galleries, and a paid-for photo sharing service on which to publish them. Jalbum software has been used to create over 32 million photo galleries, with over 700,000 users hosting theirs on Jalbum.net.


== Software ==
Jalbum can be thought of as similar to Google's Picasa, or Apple's iPhoto, and is credited as being extremely easy to use, flexible and versatile. It relies on the Java virtual machine, so can be run on most operating systems, and is available in 32 languages.
The software allows users to manage their photo collection, sorting photos into albums, performing basic digital editing and commenting individual photos. The main focus is on producing HTML and Flash based galleries, for publishing online or distributing via other means. Users can customise the look and functionality of their photo galleries by using a small set of templates or skins that come with the program, or by choosing from over 100 skins available for free download. The community, that has formed around Jalbum produces a variety of creative skins, offering galleries based on standard HTML designs, AJAX slideshows and popular Flash based image viewers.
Jalbum was created by Swedish programmer David Ekholm in 2002.
