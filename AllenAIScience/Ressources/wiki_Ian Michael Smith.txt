Ian Michael Smith (born May 5, 1987) is an American actor, known for his starring role in Simon Birch.
His short physical stature (3 ft 1 in (0.94 m)) is a result of Morquio syndrome, a rare enzymatic disorder affecting the circulatory, muscular and skeletal systems.


== Life and workEdit ==
Smith was born in Elmhurst, Illinois. He has a brother Brian.
A Chicago-area hospital worker approached his parents about him auditioning for the leading role in The Mighty, a feature film about a character with Morquio Syndrome. Kieran Culkin was cast instead, but Smith was recommended for the title role of Simon Birch (1998), a film based loosely on John Irving's novel A Prayer for Owen Meany, which also called for a small child actor.
He graduated from York Community High School in Elmhurst in 2005. He has undergone several operations including a spinal fusion and two bilateral osteotomies. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2009, and Gallaudet University in 2012.
