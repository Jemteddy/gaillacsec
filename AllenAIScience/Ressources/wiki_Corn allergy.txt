Corn/Maize allergy is a type of food allergy. It can be a difficult allergy to manage, particularly in the United States, due to the high number of food products which contain various forms of corn, such as corn starch, modified food starch, vinegar, and vanilla extract, among many others. However, it is an allergy that often goes unrecognized.


== Symptoms ==
As a result of a possible immunoglobulin E (IgE) allergy to corn, symptoms can resemble that of any other recognized allergy, including anaphylaxis. Reactions to corn derivatives, such as corn syrup, are also possible.
