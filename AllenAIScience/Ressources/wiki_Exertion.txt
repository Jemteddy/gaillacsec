Exertion is the use of physical or perceived energy. It normally connotes a strenuous or costly effort related to physical, muscular, philosophical actions and work.


== PhysicalEdit ==
In physics exertion is use of energy against, or for, inertia as described by Isaac Newton's third law of motion. In mechanics it describes use of force against a body in direction of its motion (see vector).


== MedicalEdit ==
In medical terms exertion is the expenditure of energy by skeletal muscles. The intensity of this action can be measured by the rate of which oxygen is expended, heat is produced and heart rate. A frequently used term is rating of perceived exertion or RPE-scale, also known as the Borg scale, which is use of a scale to indicate a quantitative feeling of fatigue.


== CyberneticsEdit ==
Exertion can be proxied or extended when applied to various human-machine interfaces, like prosthesis, remote control - even for games.
