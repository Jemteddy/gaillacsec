Stefan Edberg was the defending champion but lost in the final 6–0, 7–6(7–1), 6–4 to Boris Becker.
Becker's semi-final against top seed Ivan Lendl is the second longest ever Wimbledon semi-final at four hours and one minute long, behind the 2013 semi-final between Novak Djokovic and Juan Martin Del Potro (four hours and forty-three minutes).
John McEnroe reached the semifinal, losing to Edberg. It was his best showing in a Grand Slam tournament since his 1984 U.S. Open championship. The tournament also featured the first appearance of future champion Michael Stich in the main draw.
