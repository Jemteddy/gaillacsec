The Tertiary Student Rugby League World Cup, also known as the University Rugby League World Cup, first took place in 1986 in New Zealand, when the then five test nations each entered a side in what was the first non-first grade World Cup hosted by the Rugby League International Federation.
The value of the Tertiary level to Rugby League in terms of spreading the sport, particularly in countries like Great Britain, France and New Zealand, led to a World Cup being created as an incentive to help grow this level of the game.
Since 1986, five more tournaments have been held, and sixteen different nations have taken part. The benefits the tournament has provided to the sport cannot be doubted, with strong Tertiary competitions now existing in England, Wales, France, New Zealand, Australia, and new ones developing.
Whilst the 2008 tournament will not be the largest Tertiary Student Rugby League World Cup ever held, it will still play an important role in the game at this level, continuing to give a platform for players and nations to strive for.

=== 1992 ===
The 1992 World Cup moved to Australia, and in addition to the continuing strength of the Australian student game, also saw the rise of the Pacific Islanders. Their senior teams were to make a big impression in the Halifax Centenary World Cup in 1995, but in 1992, Fiji, Samoa and in particular, Tonga, proved to be an instant hit.

=== 1996 ===
The Halifax Student Rugby League 1996 World Cup in England again saw an increase in the number of teams taking part, but unfortunately for the home nations, still no home success. Japan entered the rugby league world stage for the first time, and the USA carried on the good work of their senior side in 1995, by not only participating, but beating the Irish. France proved to be the most successful of the European teams. Australian Rugby League sent to England a senior referee on tour for the first time selected from the Australian Referees State Associations (Mr Reginald Banush) who referee a final between the best players selected from all the competing nations, to play in a game : Northern Hemisphere verses Southern Hemisphere. This game was played under the EU flag of nations to show support to the "good will of sport", this game was played with a very high quality of skill by the selected players from both sides
