Eubacterium could be either a Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria genus in the family Eubacteriaceae. These bacteria are characterised by a rigid cell wall. They may either be motile or non-motile. If motile, they have a flagellum. A typical flagellum consists of a basal body, filament, and hook. The long filament is the organ which helps eubacteria move.
Gram-positive bacteria have a thick proteoglycan layer and uptake violet gram-stain (whereas gram-negative bacteria have a thinner proteoglycan layer which is surrounded by a layer of immune-response-inducing lipopolysaccharide, and do not uptake gram-stain). Species from this genus have been isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis.
