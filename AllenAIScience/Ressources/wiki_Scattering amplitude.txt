In quantum physics, the scattering amplitude is the amplitude of the outgoing spherical wave relative to the incoming plane wave in a stationary-state scattering process. The latter is described by the wavefunction

where  is the position vector; ;  is the incoming plane wave with the wavenumber  along the  axis;  is the outgoing spherical wave;  is the scattering angle; and  is the scattering amplitude. The dimension of the scattering amplitude is length.
The scattering amplitude is a probability amplitude and the differential cross-section as a function of scattering angle is given as its modulus squared

In the low-energy regime the scattering amplitude is determined by the scattering length.


== Partial wave expansion ==

In the partial wave expansion the scattering amplitude is represented as a sum over the partial waves,
,
where fℓ is the partial scattering amplitude and Pℓ are the Legendre polynomials.
The partial amplitude can be expressed via the partial wave S-matrix element Sℓ () and the scattering phase shift δℓ as

Then the differential cross section is given by
,
and the total elastic cross section becomes
,
where Im f(0) is the imaginary part of f(0).


== X-rays ==
The scattering length for X-rays is the Thomson scattering length or classical electron radius, .


== Neutrons ==
The nuclear neutron scattering process involves the coherent neutron scattering length, often described by .


== Quantum mechanical formalism ==
A quantum mechanical approach is given by the S matrix formalism.
