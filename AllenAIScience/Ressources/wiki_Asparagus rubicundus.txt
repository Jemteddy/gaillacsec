Asparagus rubicundus ("Wild Asparagus") is a fluffy, thorny shrub of the Asparagus genus, that is indigenous to South Africa and southern Namibia.
It occurs throughout the southern and western Cape, as far north as Namibia, in coarse sandy soil in fynbos vegetation and coastal sand plains.
The young shoots of this plant are edible, like those of commercial asparagus.
