The "Chirping" Crickets is the self-titled debut album from the American rock and roll band the Crickets, led by Buddy Holly. In 2003, the album was ranked number 421 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Following the album, Holly also pursued a solo career with a string of successful singles, and a full-length effort, eponymously titled Buddy Holly in 1958.
The LP was released in the US in 1957, and in the UK in 1958, and was out of print for many years. It was reissued as a remastered CD in 2004 with bonus tracks.
