"Vita vidder" ("White horizons") was the Swedish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1971, performed in Swedish by Family Four.
The song says that many people of Northern Europe (such as Sweden) like to travel to sunny countries of Southern Europe, with beaches, sunny days and warm nights, but the band prefers the white horizons with snows of Sweden.
The song was performed twelfth on the night (following Italy's Massimo Ranieri with "L'amore è un attimo" and preceding Ireland's Angela Farrell with "One Day Love"). At the close of voting, it had received 85 points, placing 6th in a field of 18.
It was succeeded as Swedish representative at the 1972 Contest by Family Four with "Härliga sommardag".
