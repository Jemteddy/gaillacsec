The Sangihe hanging parrot (Loriculus catamene) is a small (length: 12-13.5 cm) parrot endemic to the small island of Sangihe, north of Sulawesi, Indonesia.
This is an arboreal parrot. It is predominantly green, with a red throat patch, rump, elongated uppertail-coverts and tip of tail.
In 2009 this parrot was downlisted from Endangered to Near Threatened because although it has a very small range within which there has been extensive forest loss and fragmentation, it apparently remains common in degraded and cultivated habitats and there is no evidence of a continuing decline. The current population is estimated at between 10000 and 46000 individuals.
