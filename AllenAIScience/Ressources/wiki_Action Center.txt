Action Center is a notification center included with Windows Phone 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile. It was first introduced with Windows Phone 8.1 in July 2014, and was introduced to the desktop with the launch of Windows 10 on July 29, 2015.

== FeaturesEdit ==
Action Center allows for 4 quick settings, and in Windows 10 users can expand the view to show all settings. Notifications are sorted into categories by app, and users can swipe right to clear notifications. Action Center also supports actionable notifications starting with Windows 10. In the mobile version, the user can swipe from the top to the bottom to invoke Action Center, and further features introduced in Windows Phone 8.1 include the ability to change simple settings such as volume controls. The new notifications area's design allows the user to for example change wireless networks, turn Bluetooth and Airplane Mode on or off, and access "Driving Mode" from four customisable boxes at the top of the screen, while beneath these four horizontally placed boxes include recent text messages and social integration. On the desktop version, the user can invoke Action Center by clicking on its icon on the taskbar, or by swiping from the right.
