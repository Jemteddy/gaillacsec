The Long March 7 (Chinese: 长征七号运载火箭), or Chang Zheng 7 as in pinyin, abbreviated LM-7 for export or CZ-7 within China, is a Chinese liquid-fuelled carrier rocket, which is being developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. Its maiden flight is scheduled for 2016. 
As one of the new generation rocket family of Long March 5, Long March 6 and Long March 7, it is to be a medium-heavy launch vehicle and fits the gap between the heavy Long March 5 family and the small-mid Long March 6 family.
The structure will be based on the reliable man-rated Long March 2F rocket. Thus it will inherit the 3.35m-diameter core stage and 2.25m-diameter liquid rocket boosters. However, it will use LOX/kerosene fuel instead of the expensive and dangerous N2O4/UDMH fuels used previously in the Long March 2 rocket family. The new engine is borrowed from the engines developed for Long March 5, similar to Long March 6. The target is to build a more cost-effective and less environmentally damaging rocket family to replace today's Long March 2 and potentially Long March 3 serial to satisfy both domestic and international launch market needs. It will be capable of placing 5,500 kilograms (12,100 lb) of payload into a sun-synchronous orbit.
With payloads in the range of 10-20 tons cited, it is likely to use two YF-100 first-stage engines at the 1st core stage, and one YF-100 engine for each of its 4 liquid rocket boosters.
Bradley Perrett from Aviation Week writes that the description of Long March 7 corresponds with the mid-sized launcher that the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology detailed in 2007. The configuration displayed then had the two K3 core modules, four K2 boosters and a special 3-meter-dia. module, H3, that would presumably be an optional third stage for missions beyond low Earth orbit. But the range of payloads quoted for Long March 7, 10-20 tons, shows that it would be built with a variety of booster combinations. A single YF-100 would presumably provide second-stage propulsion.
