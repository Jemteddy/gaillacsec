A Change of Seasons is an EP by progressive metal/rock band Dream Theater, released on September 19, 1995 through East West Records. It comprises the 23-minute title track and a collection of bonus live covers performed at a fan club concert at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London, England.
The title track, which was recorded at BearTracks Studios in New York, includes audio samples from the 1989 film Dead Poets Society and quotes from the 1648 Robert Herrick poem, To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time, was originally to be released on the 1992 album Images and Words. The lyrics, written by the band's then-drummer Mike Portnoy, were not inspired by the movie but rather the death of his mother. A Change of Seasons was also the first Dream Theater release featuring Derek Sherinian on keyboards.
An edited version of the title track was used in a downhill skiing feature during the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.
Although the record is labeled as an EP, at 57:30, it is much longer than a standard EP, or, indeed, many LPs. In fact, it is longer than Dream Theater's first two albums. Portnoy has said "It was important for us and the label for it not to be perceived as the latest studio record. That's why we tagged it an EP."
