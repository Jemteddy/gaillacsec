Also known as the Delta Classic, The Delta Classic 4 Literacy is a college football game held between historically black colleges. It is held annually in Little Rock, Arkansas.


== History ==
Fitz Hill created the event, then known as the Literacy Classic while serving as head football coach at San Jose State University. After becoming president of Arkansas Baptist College, Hill restarted the event in Little Rock as The Delta Classic 4 Literacy, with the intent of raising awareness regarding illiteracy in the Delta region. Proceeds from the game go to the Arkansas Literacy Council. The first game in the Arkansas version of the Delta Classic was played between Grambling State University and the University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff in October, 2006, with UAPB gaining the victory en route to winning the Southwestern Athletic Conference Western Division title that season. In the second Delta Classic held on October 13, 2007 Grambling State defeated UAPB 30-24. UAPB currently has a 3-4 record in the Delta Classic, including two victories against Grambling State in 2006 and 2009.
