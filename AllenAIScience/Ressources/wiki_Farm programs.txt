In United States agricultural policy, the term farm programs is generally meant to include the commodity programs administered by the Farm Service Agency, as well as the other USDA programs that directly benefit farmers. Some examples of the other programs include farm loans, federal crop insurance, the Noninsured Assistance Program (NAP), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), and conservation cost sharing, and the "food stamps" program of SNAP, which is included in each farm spending bill because it acts as a subsidy, keeping crop prices higher by increasing financial demand for food by about eighty billion dollars per year (in 2014).
