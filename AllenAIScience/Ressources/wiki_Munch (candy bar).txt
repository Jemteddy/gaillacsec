Munch is a candy bar manufactured by Mars, Incorporated and sold in the United States. The bar was introduced in 1970 as the Snickers Munch Bar and was later relabeled "Munch". It is made of only six ingredients: peanuts, sugar, butter, corn syrup, salt and soy lecithin.
The candy bar contains no chocolate and is comparable to peanut brittle, though the Munch bar has a higher density of peanuts compared to most brittles.
Due to its short list of simple ingredients, it is marketed as being healthy and natural.
