Save the Amazon Rainforest Organization (STARO) is a charity that aims to save the Amazon rainforest from destruction, and is based in London in the United Kingdom.


== Introduction ==
STARO stands for Save The Amazon Rainforest Organization and was created by Jessica Hatfield and Dieter Bratschi as a (registered charity number 1116002)to promote for the benefit of the public, the preservation and conservation of the Amazon Rainforest; advance the education in such subjects and to promote research into the climate, flora and fauna of the Amazon Rainforest to publish the useful results. STARO works with the local dwellers to promote sustainable income sources such as beekeeping, nut gathering and other activities. There is only 2% of the Rain forest left worldwide. At first the people who created STARO wanted to make a charity to save gorillas but that didn't work out so decided to change it to rainforests instead.
