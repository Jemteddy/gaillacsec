Social Studies is an cross-disciplinary subject taught in most American schools. It is defined by the National Council for Social Studies as "the integrated study of the social sciences and humanities to promote civic competence." More specifically, social studies covers both the features of our surroundings and the history of people and places.
Normally, Social Studies is divided into History and Geography when the student has reached sixth grade or near. Some American schools do not have separate classes on geography at the secondary level.
Social Studies is labelled as a main subject in most schools. Social Studies is often among students' least favorite subjects, even though it covers historical facts and geographical features.
