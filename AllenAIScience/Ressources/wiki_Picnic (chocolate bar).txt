Picnic is a brand of chocolate bar consisting of milk chocolate and peanuts, covering chewy nougat, caramel, biscuit and puffed rice. Picnic bars are lumpy in shape. It is sold in Australia, parts of Canada (such as Quebec), New Zealand, New York City, India, Ireland, Russia, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. The UK and Indian versions differ from the Australasian version in that they also contain raisins. The Cadbury Picnic bar was first released in the UK in 1958.
A popular slogan for the Picnic, released in the early 2000s, was "Deliciously ugly". During the 1970s the Australian slogan for Picnic was "More like a banquet than a picnic". Picnic is manufactured by Cadbury UK.
In Australia, limited-edition variants Picnic Honeycomb (a Picnic bar with honeycomb pieces), Picnic Hedgehog (a picnic bar with biscuit pieces) and Picnic Rocky Road (a Picnic bar with mini marshmallows and gumdrops) have been sold in recent years. In 2010, a limited edition Almond Picnic bar was made available in New Zealand and is now also available in Australia under the name Roast Almond Feast. A Picnic ice cream is also manufactured by Cadbury UK.
In April 2009 Cadbury altered the weight of the standard Picnic bar from 50 grams down to 48.4 grams. Again in August 2014 Cadbury altered the weight of the standard Picnic bar down to 46g in Australia, with a noticeable reduction in the width of the bar, yet still in the old size wrapper.
In the UK the bar is also available in multipacks.
In 2011, a fruit and nut picnic bar was released in Australia.
