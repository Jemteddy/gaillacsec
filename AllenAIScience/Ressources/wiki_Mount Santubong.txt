Mount Santubong (Malay: Gunung Santubong) is a mountain in the Malaysian state of Sarawak. It is located about 35 km north of the state capital Kuching.


== Biological importance ==
In 1855 a British naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace[1] who was staying at Santubong while collecting specimens in Sarawak, wrote a paper while called "Sarawak Law" [2] which can be considered as a precursor to the biological theory of evolution.


== Ascent ==
Mount Santubong lies within a gazetted national park of the same name. Entry to the park is now via the temporary Sarawak Forestry Corporation park headquarter entrance. The issue of custodian of park entry has now been put to rest by the relevant authorities
