Barkan (Hebrew: בַּרְקָן), is an Israeli settlement in the northern West Bank, about 25 km east of Tel Aviv and 8 km west of Salfit, under the administrative local government of the Shomron Regional Council. According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, the population was 1,200 at the end of 2004.
The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.


== History ==
Founded in June 1981 by secular Israelis from the Beitar and Herut movements, Barkan is part of a chain of settlements built along the Trans-Samaria Highway, and adjacent to the Barkan Industrial Park. The park, established in 1982, has 120 businesses and factories manufacturing plastics, metal-work, food, textile, and more. Of the 5,000 workers, 90% are Palestinian Arabs. The original name of the town was Beit Abba after Abba Ahimeir, a leader of the Lehi.


== Archaeology ==
An archeological site east of the town contains remnants of an Israelite settlement during the time of the first and second temples.
