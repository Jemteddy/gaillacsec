Radio Waves is a comedy album by The Bob & Tom Show, which was not released to the general public but only to men and women serving overseas in the US military in October 2009. It is a single disc CD which represents original material recorded during the syndicated, daily radio show and with other studio numbers which had not been previously presented on air. While it is not sold in stores, one can own a copy by piecing together the tracks from previous albums and making a compilation CD.
