Cocido montañés (Highlander stew or Mountain stew), is a rich hearty bean stew, originally from and most commonly found in Cantabria in northern Spain.
Cocido montañés is a hot and heavy dish whose origin was in the 17th century and it was cooked to fight against the cold and wet climate in the Cantabrian mountains. For that reason is most commonly eaten during winter and at the largest meal of the day, lunch. It is usually served as a starter course, but may also be the main course of the meal.


== Ingredients ==
Cocido montañés is made with two vegetal ingredients, dried large white beans (soaked overnight before use) and collard greens (berza). Some recipes use local red bean caricu montañés instead of white beans or cabbage instead of hard-to-find collard greens. The rest of the elements of this recipe are known as compangu which refers to the meat ingredients from the pig slaughter, bacon (tocino), pork ribs (costilla), rice black pudding (morcilla) and chorizo.
