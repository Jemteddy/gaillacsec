Stewart is a small unincorporated community in Jordan Township, Warren County, Indiana. It sits at the south end of the short Bee Line Railroad and consists of a single residence and a grain elevator operated by the Stewart Grain Company. The original elevator, built in 1905 and rebuilt in 1910 after a fire, still stands although it was moved 500 feet to a non-working location in 2009 for historical and sentimental reasons.
