Sporting Clube de Portugal, OM, ComC, MHIH (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈspɔɾtĩŋ ˈkluβ(ɨ) ðɨ puɾtuˈɣaɫ]) (Euronext: SCP) or Sporting CP (often colloquially known as Sporting in Lusophone countries and as Sporting Lisbon in Anglophone countries) is a Portuguese sports club based in Lisbon. Although they compete in a number of different sports, Sporting are best known for their association football team.
Founded in Lisbon on 1 July 1906, they are one of the "Três Grandes" (The Big Three) football clubs in Portugal. With 120,000 club members, their teams, athletes and supporters are often nicknamed Leões (English: Lions) by their fans.
Sporting were a founding member of the Primeira Liga and, together with Benfica and FC Porto, have never been relegated from the First Division of Portuguese football since the league's establishment in 1934. Sporting are the third most successful Portuguese football club, with forty-five titles in Portuguese competitions and one international title, the 1963–64 European Cup Winners' Cup. Domestically, they have won eighteen Primeira Liga titles, sixteen Portuguese Cups (six doubles), four Championship of Portugal titles (a record tied with Porto) and eight Portuguese SuperCup titles.
Sporting Clube de Portugal are ranked thirty-seventh in UEFA club rankings.


== HistoryEdit ==
The UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1963-1964 was won by Sporting Clube de Portugal, who defeated MTK Budapest of Hungary in the final. It was the only time a Portuguese team side won a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup trophy.
Sporting CP entered the competition defeating Atalanta in the qualifying round, then past APOEL F.C. (in what was the biggest win in a single UEFA competitions game to date: 16–1), Manchester United, Olympique Lyonnais and in the end defeated MTK Budapest in a two round final to win their first European title.

Sporting also reached a second European final, being runners-up in the 2005 UEFA Cup Final against PFC CSKA Moscow.
Sporting reached three other European semi-finals. In both the Cup Winners Cup of 1974 and the UEFA Cup of 1991, it lost to the eventual winners of the competition. In 2012, Sporting reached their fifth European semi-final in its history, losing to Athletic Bilbao of Spain in the UEFA Europa League.


== NameEdit ==
Within Portugal, Sporting Clube de Portugal is often referred to simply as "Sporting" or "Sporting Portugal". Outside Portugal, the club is often known as "Sporting Lisbon". The club has attempted to shed this name, particularly through ex-president Sousa Cintra and his staff, in an effort to become known abroad by its correct name. Despite this, some non-Portuguese media still uses Sporting Lisbon due to precedent and to avoid confusion with other clubs such as Sporting Clube de Braga, Sporting Clube da Covilhã, Sporting Clube Farense, Sporting Clube Olhanense and Sporting de Gijón. UEFA has historically used the designation Sporting CP in English-language scorelines and match reports on its own site, but as of January 2010 uses the club's full Portuguese name.


== Team colorsEdit ==
Sporting ever since its formation in 1906 has always had the green and white colours. The first kit from 1907 was all white, until 1908 when they introduced the now referred by fans as "Classic" kit, with the vertical stripes.


=== KitsEdit ===


=== CrestsEdit ===
Since its formation, on 1 July 1906, Sporting has had six crests, all of which have included the colour green and the lion. There were the 50 years and the 100 years anniversary crests, but they got removed the following year.

These were the anniversary crests, the ones used in 1956 and 2006. These weren't actually worn in kits which were played in matches but were used as emblems by fans. Notably, the 50 years anniversary crest came with the 1956 Estádio José Alvalade which was destroyed later in order for the new Estádio José Alvalade which was built for the UEFA Euro 2004 championship in Portugal.
