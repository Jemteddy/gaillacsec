The red slug (Arion rufus), also known as the large red slug, chocolate arion and European red slug, is a species of land slug in the family Arionidae, the roundback slugs.


== Description ==
This slug is distinguished from similar species by the position of its respiratory pore toward the front of its mantle, the lack of a keel on its back, and a wrinkled surface. It varies in color from orange or red to brown or black. The fringe of its foot is red-striped and its tentacles are dark. It is 7 to 14 centimeters long. Its mucus is sticky.
The eggs are about half a centimeter long and are whitish when new, turning yellow-brown.
It is very similar to the black slug, A. ater. The two can only be distinguished with certainty by dissection or molecular analysis. It has been treated as a subspecies of A. ater in the past.


== Range ==
This species is probably native to northwestern Europe. Its distribution is unclear. It has been widely introduced and it is easily confused with other species.


== Ecology ==
It is known from wooded areas and dry coastal habitat, and is commonly found in gardens.


== Behavior ==
Like most other slug species, the red slug elongates while in locomotion, and at rest it contracts into a hemispherical shape. It performs a rocking motion when disturbed. It is an omnivore.
