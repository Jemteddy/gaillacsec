Soil management concerns all operations, practices, and treatments used to protect soil and enhance its performance.


== Practices ==
Soil management practices that affect soil quality:
Controlling traffic on the soil surface helps to reduce soil compaction, which can reduce aeration and water infiltration.
Cover crops keep the soil anchored and covered in off-seasons so that the soil is not eroded by wind and rain.
Crop rotations for row crops alternate high-residue crops with lower-residue crops to increase the amount of plant material left on the surface of the soil during the year to protect the soil from erosion.
Nutrient management can help to improve the fertility of the soil and the amount of organic matter content, which improves soil structure and function.
Tillage, especially reduced-tillage or no-till operations limit the amount of soil disturbance while cultivating a new crop, and help to maintain plant residues on the surface of the soil for erosion protection and water retention.
