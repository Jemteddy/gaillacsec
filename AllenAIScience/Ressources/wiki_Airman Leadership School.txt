Airman Leadership School (ALS) is a six-week-long United States Air Force program designed to develop Airmen into effective front-line supervisors. It is the first professional military education (PME) that enlisted Air Force members encounter. ALS focuses on developing leadership abilities, the profession of arms, and building effective communication.

John Levitow Award - The highest award presented at Airman Leadership School, it is the pinnacle of success in ALS and Enlisted PME. The Levitow award is presented to the student that demonstrated the most outstanding leadership and scholastic qualities. Selection for the Levitow award is based on academic performance and assignment of points by peers and instructors (although it is unclear what weight each category carries in determining winner).
Commandant Leadership Award - Presented to the student who has displayed all the characteristics of an effective leader, but is not based at all on academic standings.

This award is unique when considering the peer points, instructor points and board scores needed.
