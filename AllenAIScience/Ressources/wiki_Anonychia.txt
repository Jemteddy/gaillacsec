Anonychia is the absence of nails, an anomaly, which may be the result of a congenital ectodermal defect, ichthyosis, severe infection, severe allergic contact dermatitis, self-inflicted trauma, Raynaud phenomenon, lichen planus, epidermolysis bullosa, or severe exfoliative diseases.


== Congenital form ==
This is rare and is usually due to mutations in the R-spondin 4 (RSPO4) gene which is located on the short arm of chromosome 20 (20p13). Clinically it is manifest by the absence (anonychia) or hypoplasia (hyponuchia) of finger- and/or toenails.
