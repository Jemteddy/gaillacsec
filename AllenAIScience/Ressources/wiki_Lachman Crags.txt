The Lachman Crags (63°52′S 57°50′W) form an escarpment which extends in a north–south direction for about 5 nautical miles (9 km), its high point rising to 645 metres (2,120 ft), standing 3 nautical miles (6 km) south-southwest of Cape Lachman on James Ross Island, Antarctica. It was surveyed by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1945, and named after Cape Lachman.
