Terra Film is a Berlin-based film production company. Founded in 1920, it became one of Germany's largest film production companies in the 1930s.

In 1930, the Swiss Scotoni family, headed by Eugen Scotoni, acquired Terra for 1.2 million Reichsmarks. Many of the 40 films from the era of Ralph Scotoni (who joined the Nazi party in 1933) were influenced by Nazi ideas, transfer was also on Swiss materials and locations (William Tell, 1934; The Knight of Pontresina, 1934; Hermione and the Seven Law, 1935). However, since the films lost money, the family sold its stake in Terra Scotoni film in 1935.
