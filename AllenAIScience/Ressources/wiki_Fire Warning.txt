A Fire Warning (SAME code: FRW) is a warning issued by civil authorities in the United States to inform the public of major, uncontrolled fires (usually wildfires) threatening populated areas and/or major roadways. A Red flag warning, a warning issued by the National Weather Service when low relative humidity and high winds and temperatures are expected, will generally precede any fire activity by at least one to two days. A fire warning will generally include information on the location and movement of the fire, evacuation instructions, and shelter locations.
