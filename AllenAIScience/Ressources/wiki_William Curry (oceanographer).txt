William Curry, Ph.D., Director, Ocean and Climate Change Institute at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute Geology and Geophysics Department. He holds a Bachelor of Science, University of Delaware, 1974, with specialization in Geology, and a Ph.D from Brown University, 1980, also with a specialization in Geology.
Dr. Curry studies the history of earth's climate and carbon cycle using geological records of ocean chemistry and physical properties. He is actively involved with sea going expeditions to collect deep sea sediments and uses the chemistry of fossils in the sediments to determine how climate has changed on decadal to millennial time scales. He has been a member of the Scientific Staff at WHOI since 1981.
