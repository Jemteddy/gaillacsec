On 18 June 2013, a Virgin Australia Boeing 737-800 operating a flight from Brisbane to Adelaide with 91 passengers and crew onboard diverted to Mildura due to heavy fog which had closed Adelaide airport. The flight carried enough fuel to allow roughly 30 minutes holding. A Qantas 737 had also diverted to Mildura, arriving after the Virgin flight and radioed that they were running low on fuel. This was interpreted by the Virgin crew as an urgent situation and they allowed the Qantas flight to land ahead. With the airport's automated weather service unavailable and the visibility deteriorating, the Virgin flight conducted a missed approach and now critically low on fuel were forced to commit to an immediate emergency landing. Mildura airport is not equipped with an Instrument Landing System approach aid and the crew performed the landing without visual reference to the runway on the second attempt. The aircraft landed with 535 kg (1,179 lb) remaining fuel.
On 6th of November 2015, a Cessna crashed on approach into Mildura airport. The plane was on a trip from Moorabbin airport. The plane crashed into power lines setting it alight almost immediately, the pilot of the Cessna died at the scene.
