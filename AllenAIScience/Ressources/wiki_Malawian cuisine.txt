Malawian cuisine includes the foods and culinary practices of Malawi. Tea and fish are popular features of Malawian cuisine. Sugar, coffee, corn, potatoes, sorghum, cattle and goats are also important components of the cuisine and economy. Lake Malawi is a source of fish including chambo (similar to bream) usipa (similar to sardine), mpasa (similar to salmon and kampango). Nsima is a food staple made from ground corn and served with side dishes of meat and vegetable. It can be eaten for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Additional dishes in Malawi include:
Kachumbari, a type of tomato and onion salad
Kondowole, made from cassava flour and water. It is primarily form northern Malawi and is a very sticky meal resembling Malawian nsima, Tanzanian ugali, or English posho. It is mostly cooked on the floor because of its texture as it is normally tough to run a cooking stick through hence a lot of strength is needed. Kondowole is normally eaten with fish.


== Fish ==
Fish in Malawi ranges from "utaka" (pronounced "u-ta-ka") and "chambo" (a famous fish from Lake Malawi). Kondowole is not a meal that can be made in bulk because of its consistency and texture, therefore is not as frequently eaten as nsima.
