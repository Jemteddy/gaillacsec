The Black Lamb is a six-issue comic book limited series that takes place in a science fantasy setting. Published in late 1996 and early 1997 by DC Comics as part of their now defunct Helix imprint, the series was written and drawn by Tim Truman.
Set in an unnamed near future city that has a cyberpunk appearance and feel, The Black Lamb stars a character named Diarmaid Donn, a centuries old vampire who is originally from medieval Ireland. Donn, known as the Black Lamb, is a figure authorized by the supernatural elements of the city, known collectively as the Tribes of the Night, as judge, jury and executioner in matters pertaining to the protection of the Tribes of the Night.
Told mostly from the point of view of the title character, a significant amount of time also finds the story told from the point of view of a supporting character named Commissioner Damn. Damn is a police officer who has the ability to sense supernatural beings.
Although some members of the Tribes of the Night live above ground, the majority reside, hidden in secret, in a huge maze of underground caverns beneath the city.
In the back of issue #1, Tim Truman wrote a column titled "Out for Blood" in which he noted the influences and inspirations for The Black Lamb. Among the named sources are James Whale's 1931 motion picture version of Frankenstein, the stories featuring Fu Manchu and The Iron Dream by science fiction writer, Norman Spinrad.


== Publication history ==
The six issues of The Black Lamb are broken up into four semi-related stories. Issue #1 (dated November 1996) is a stand alone story which introduces the Black Lamb and Commissioner Damn. Issues #2 (dated December 1996) and #3 (dated January 1997) tell a story in which the Black Lamb must deal with a war between two tribes of werewolves. Issue #3 also tells the Black Lamb's origin. Issue #4 (dated February 1997) deals with the first meeting between the Black Lamb and Commissioner Damn as they deal with a group of hunters (known in this universe as specialists) who have come to the city. Issues #5 (dated March 1997) and #6 (dated April 1997) finish up the series as the Black Lamb recruits Commissioner Damn and a number of other supporting characters who appeared in the other issues to stop a plot launched by Dracula.
Tim Turman was unsatisfied with a new printing process used on The Black Lamb that he felt hurt the series in its original printing.
In 2008, he authorised the free online release of the series by Comicmix.com.

In medieval Ireland, Diarmaid Donn lives with his wife (a normal human) and children. Like other vampires of his world, he was born a vampire with a mortal lifespan just slightly longer than a human. His son was born a human, but his daughter was born a vampire like him.
When their small farm is attacked by Vikings Donn's wife and son are killed. Recognizing them as vampires the attackers take Donn and his daughter as prisoners. Donn's daughter is tortured to death, her last words being a request to her father to drink her blood to give him strength so that he may survive. It is an act that will make him immortal, but will also make him a social outcast among the Tribes of the Night. He does so, becomes an immortal and kills his jailers.
