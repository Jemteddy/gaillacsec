== Cast and charactersEdit ==
Bonnie Hunt as Bonnie Malloy, the mother of two children (3 in season 1), loving wife, and host of a local TC talk show. Bonnie tries to maintain a public image of the perfect wife and mother, but in reality her life is chaotic.
Mark Derwin as Mark Malloy, a doctor, Bonnie's husband and the father of their children. He looks on as she tries to balance her hectic life. Mark is much less concerned about what other people think than Bonnie is, which causes problems on occasion. He has a generally more professional demeanor, and sometimes doesn't understand why Bonnie continues to put up with annoying people in her life.
Charlie Stewart as Charlie Malloy, Bonnie's son. Charlie shares most of his scenes with his friend Frankie. His role is small and usually unscripted although he adds priceless comedy to the show.

Marianne Muellerleile as Gloria, Bonnie's live-in housekeeper/nanny. It was stated in the show that she was only intended to stay there until Charlie started school, but despite the fact that she actually provided little help, they could not let her leave because they had grown attached to her.
