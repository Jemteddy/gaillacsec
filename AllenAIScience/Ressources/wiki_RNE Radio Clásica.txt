RNE Radio Clásica is a Spanish radio station, operated by Radio Nacional de España (RNE), part of Spain's state-owned public broadcasting organization, Corporación de Radio y Televisión Española.
Launched in November 1965 as the Segundo Programa (second programme) of RNE – and subsequently known as RNE 2 (1988–94), later still as RNE C (1994–99) – Radio Clásica's schedule is made up of presenter-led programmes of classical music (in the widest sense) plus relays (both live and recorded) of concerts, other musical recitals, and complete operas.
The station also showcases such genres as flamenco, folk music, zarzuela, and jazz, as well as "established" popular music. It is unusual amongst Spanish radio stations in including no news bulletins in its schedules.
