Ogmodirus is an extinct genus of plesiosaur with an extremely long neck that lived in the Cretaceous. It may be member of the Elasmosauridae, a group of marine animals related to Elasmosaurus, but the condition of the fossils discovered to date means the genus is dubious. The type species, Ogmodirus martini, was named by Samuel Wendell Williston and Roy L. Moodie in 1913. The original specimen consisted of a pelvic girdle, limb elements, and more than fifty cervical (neck) vertebrae discovered in Cloud County, Kansas. A second species, Ogmodirus ischiadicus, has since been referred to Styxosaurus. Sepkoski (2002) assigned Ogmodirus to the Plesiosauria.
