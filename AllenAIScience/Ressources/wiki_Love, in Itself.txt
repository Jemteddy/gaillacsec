"Just Can't Get Enough" became a hit of its own in the Netherlands in early 1985. It wasn't released as a separate single, so it was the 12" single (L12Bong4) that entered the Dutch chart. Officially it wasn't allowed in the singles charts as the 12" had been sold (and priced) as a mini-LP in the weeks before that. But due to its popularity on the radio, "Just Can't Get Enough" was allowed to enter and duly became Depeche Mode's biggest Dutch hit of all time.
