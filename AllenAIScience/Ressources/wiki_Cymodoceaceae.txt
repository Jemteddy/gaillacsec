Cymodoceaceae is a family of flowering plants, sometimes known as the "manatee-grass family", the family Cymodoceaceae includes only marine species.  Many taxonomists have not recognized this family.
The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), does recognize Cymodoceaceae and places it in the order Alismatales, in the clade monocots. The family includes five genera, totalling 16 species of marine plants occurring in tropical seas and oceans (so-called seagrasses).
According to the AP-Website it is doubtful if the family Ruppiaceae is distinct enough to be kept apart: the plants in the three families Cymodoceaceae, Posidoniaceae and Ruppiaceae form a monophyletic group.
