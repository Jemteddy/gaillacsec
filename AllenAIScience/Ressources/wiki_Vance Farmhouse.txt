Vance Farmhouse, also known as Meeks Farmhouse, Dean's House, and Bicentennial House, is a historic home located on a West Virginia University farm at Morgantown, Monongalia County, West Virginia. The original section was built about 1854, and is a two-story, I house form brick dwelling. The 1 1/2 story rear addition was built before 1900, and the two-story side addition on the northeast elevation was added in the 1930s. It features a wrap-around porch added sometime before 1900. The property was acquired for the West Virginia University Experiment Station in 1899. It housed the dean of the College of Agriculture from 1915 to 1957. During the United States Bicentennial in 1976, it was used as a showcase for exhibits on Monongalia County history. It houses the West Virginia University Institute for the History of Technology and Industrial Archeology.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.
