2.03 is the designation of the fifth Soviet/Russian space shuttle orbiter to be produced as part of the Buran program. It carried the GRAU index serial number 11F35 K5 and is - depending on the source - also known as "OK-2K3", "Orbiter K5", "OK 2.03" or "Shuttle 2.03". It was never officially named.
2.03 was a second series shuttle orbiter, as shown by the '2' in its number. Construction of 2.03 was barely underway when the entire Soviet shuttle program was halted in 1993, and as such what parts of it had been built were dismantled shortly afterwards, and nothing remained of it by 1995.
