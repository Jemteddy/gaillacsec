Powderhall is an area lying between Broughton Road and Warriston Road in the north of Edinburgh, the Scottish capital. Until recently it was best known for Powderhall Stadium, a greyhound racing track, which has now closed. The stadium also played host to motorcycle speedway racing from 1977 to 1995, as home to the Edinburgh Monarchs, who have since relocated to Armadale. The Powderhall Sprint, first held in 1870, was a professional footrace with handicapping of the runners. It continues, since 1999, as the New Year Sprint and is now held at Musselburgh Racecourse.
The name derives from a gunpowder factory and associated buildings on the edge of the Water of Leith set up by the Balfour family of Pilrig as one of their several enterprises in the early 18th century.
The site has been redeveloped for housing and business purposes. Due to flood risk the area has new flood defences built along the river edge.
Powderhall also has one of the city's main waste transfer stations. Originally built as an incinerator ironically a new chimney on the plant was condemned in the 1990s and removed. Waste is now brought in by road and removed by rail.
