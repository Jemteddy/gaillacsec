The Proto-Kra language is the reconstructed ancestor of the Kra languages. It was reconstructed in 2000 by Weera Ostapirat in his Ph.D. dissertation.


== Lower-level reconstructions ==
Ostapirat (2000) provided preliminary phonological reconstructions for several lower-level groupings before attempting a reconstruction of Proto-Kra.
Proto-Kra
Proto-South-Western Kra
Proto-Western Kra (Gelao, Lachi)
Proto-Southern Kra (Laha)

Proto-Central-East Kra
Proto-Central Kra (Paha)
Proto-Eastern Kra (Buyang, Qabiao)


== Phonology ==


=== Consonants ===
Proto-Kra has a total of 32 consonants, seven of which (marked in green) can occur as syllable finals (Ostapirat 2000:224, 236).


=== Vowels ===
Proto-Kra has a total of 6 vowels (Ostapirat 2000:235).
Proto-Kra has 4 diphthongs, which are not found in closed syllables.
*-ai
*-aɯ
*-ui
*-au


=== Tones ===
Proto-Kra had an A–B–C–D tonal system typical of other Tai–Kadai languages (see Proto-Tai language#Tones). The tonal descriptions below are from Ostapirat (2000:237).
*A: *A is one of the most common tones.
*B: *B and *D are phonetically similar, as reflexes of tone *D are often the same as those of *B. This regularly occurs in all Kra languages except for Qabiao.
*C: *C is usually accompanied by glottal constriction and may have originally had a creaky or tense laryngeal quality. Some Gelao varieties and Yalang Buyang display the same reflex for
*D: *D is the only tone to occur exclusively in closed syllables.
The following table of phonetic characteristics of Proto-Kra tones was adapted from Ostapirat (2000:237).
