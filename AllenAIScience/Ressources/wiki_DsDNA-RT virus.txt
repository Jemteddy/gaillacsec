dsDNA-RT viruses are the seventh group in the Baltimore virus classification. They are not considered as DNA viruses (class I of Baltimore classification), but rather reverse transcribing viruses because they replicate through an RNA intermediate. It includes the families Hepadnaviridae and Caulimoviridae.
The term "pararetrovirus" is also used for this group. The term was introduced in 1985.
