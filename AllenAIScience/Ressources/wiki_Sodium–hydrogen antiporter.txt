The sodium–hydrogen antiporter or sodium–hydrogen exchanger is a membrane protein found in many cells, and especially in those of the nephron of the kidney. Specifically in the intercalary cells of the collecting duct. The membrane pump is primarily responsible for maintaining the balance of pH.


== IsoformsEdit ==
There are several isoforms of the antiporter:
Sodium–hydrogen antiporter 1
Sodium–hydrogen antiporter 2
Sodium–hydrogen antiporter 3
Sodium–hydrogen antiporter 5
Sodium–hydrogen antiporter 6
Sodium–hydrogen antiporter 8
