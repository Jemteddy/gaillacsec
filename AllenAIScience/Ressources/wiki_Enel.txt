Enel is a multinational manufacturer and distributor of electricity and gas.
Enel, which originally stood for National Entity for Electricity (Ente nazionale per l'energia elettrica), was first established as a public body at the end of 1962, and then transformed into a limited company in 1992. In 1999, following the liberalization of the electricity market in Italy, Enel was privatized. As of February 2015, the Italian government is the owner of 25.5% of the company’s shares.
In 2014, Enel employed about 70,000 people, works in about 30 countries and at the end of 2013 – with 80.5 billion euro of revenue and a market capitalization of 31 billion euro – is the 56th company in the world by revenue. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.
Enel’s logo, designed by Bob Noorda and Maurizio Minoggio, is a combination of a sun and a tree whose nine branches – or nine rays – represent the variety of services offered by the company.


== History ==


=== 1898–1962: Towards a national policy for electricity ===

In 1898, the production of electricity in Italy was of 100 million kilowatt hours reaching a value of over $56 billion by 1960. The majority of the electricity was produced by over and regional private companies, or by companies linked to other industrial bodies, that were both local and regional, by exploiting the specific characteristic of the territory: its hydrogeological resources.
The state subsidized the construction of power stations and any necessary construction work in the territory in order to increase the production of electricity. In terms of distribution, the state intervened in 1961 by unifying national tariffs on the basis of equal consumption classes (through the Equalization Fund for the Electricity Sector) and by requiring power companies to provide access to electricity to everyone.
In 1962, the government institutionalised the Entity for electricity with the aim of making electricity a means for the development of the country and in order to define a national policy for electricity based on the experiences of other countries such as France and Britain.


=== 1962: Establishing the National Entity for Electricity ===

At the beginning of 1962, the Fanfani IV Cabinet made its commitment to the government to put together a proposal for the unification of the national electricity system within three months of the parliament casting its confidence motion. During the Chamber of Deputies assembly of 26 June 1962, the government presented a bill that sanctioned the principles and procedures for the establishment of the Entity for Electricity (E.N.EL.).
According to the bill, Enel was going to acquire all assets of all companies operating in the production, processing, transmission and distribution of electricity, with the exception of self-producers – companies that produced more than 70% of their electricity for other production processes – (the same exception was later applied to municipal authorities), and of small businesses that did not produce more than 10 million kilowatt hours per year.
Procedures to assess the value of the acquired companies were defined, and it was established that compensation were to be paid to creditors in 10 years at an interest rate of 5.5%. In this framework, 1962 was to be considered a transition year, in which all income and expenses of the acquired companies would be transferred to Enel. 1963 was thus the first operational year of the newly formed company.
The first companies to be acquired were:
SIP (Piedmont)
Edison Volta (Lombardy)
SADE (Veneto)
SELT-Valdarno (Tuscany)
SRE (Lazio)
SME (Campania)
SGES (Sicily)
Carbosarda (Sardinia)


=== 1963–1970: Modernization and development of the network ===
Enel’s early goals were the modernisation and development of the electricity grid with the construction of high voltage backbones, international connections, connection to the islands, the electrification of rural areas and the creation of the National Center for dispatching. These projects were to be co-financed by the state through the issuing - in 1965 - of bonds of a value of over 200 billion Italian liras. In 1967 Enel’s supervision was redirected from the Committee of Ministers to the interministerial Committee for Economic Planning (CIPE), under the Ministry of Industry. During this period, the production of thermoelectric power surpassed for the very first time that of hydroelectric power.


==== National dispatch centre ====
In 1963, the National Dispatch Centre of Rome was created in order to manage the energy flows on the network by coordinating the production plants, the transmission network, the distribution as well as the interconnection of the Italian electricity system with that of foreign countries, by adjusting in real time the production and transmission of energy on the basis of the actual demand.


==== Rural electrification ====
In terms of rural electrification the settlements that were not connected to the electricity grid went from 1.27% in 1960 to 0.46% in 1964, with over 320,000 new residents connected. In the five-year period between 1966 and 1970 further investments for rural electrification were made – 80% of the costs were covered by the state and 20% by Enel – those were complemented by reduced rates as an incentive for agricultural development.


==== High-voltage network and connection to the islands ====
In 1968, the construction work of the 380 kV connection between Florence and Rome began with the aim of joining the high voltage electrical system of the north with that of the south centre. Around the same time international high voltage connections with France (380 kV Venaus-Villarodin, 1969) and Switzerland were also put in place.
In the same years undersea electrical cables were put in place to connect the peninsula and the islands of Elba (1966), Ischia (1967) and Sardinia through Corsica (1967).


==== The Vajont disaster ====
Enel was involved in the Vajont Dam disaster, which took place at the Vajont reservoir, which was artificially created to produce a large quantity of hydroelectric power. On 9 October 1963 a huge landslide of 260 million cubic metres fell into the reservoir. The dam and power plant had been built by SADE (Società Adriatica di Elettricità – Adriatic Electricity Company) and then sold to Edison and had just been transferred as part of the nationalisation process to the newly set up Enel.
The impact of the landslide created huge waves in the Vajont reservoir, which partially flooded the villages of Erto e Casso and swept over the dam, totally wiping out the towns in the valley below it: Longarone, Pirago, Rivalta, Villanova and Faè. Approximately two thousand people died in the disaster. Enel and Montedison, were charged at the ensuing trial as the companies responsible for the disaster, a responsibility considered all more serious because of the predictability of the event. The two companies were forced to pay damages to the communities involved in the catastrophe.


=== 1970–1980: The energy crisis and the search for new sources ===

The decade of the 1970s was distinguished by a major energy crisis that led the company to drastic austerity measures and the establishment of a national energy plan that defined the objective of both building new power plants and the search for new energy sources.


==== The energy crisis ====
In 1975, as a result of the oil crisis and the Austerity measures, and following the definition of the first National Energy Plan (PEN), the aim of the company became that of reducing Enel’s dependence on hydrocarbons. This was to be achieved with the use of other energy sources, which included hydro, geothermal, increasing the use of coal, the waste cycle and in particular with the use of nuclear energy.


==== New plants ====
Several new plants were built in the course of the decade:
In the early 1970s, the construction of the nuclear power station Caorso (Emilia-Romagna) – the first major nuclear power plant in Italy (840-860 MW) – began. The station became operational in 1978.
Between 1972 and 1978, the hydroelectric plant of Taloro was built in the province of Nuoro (Sardinia).
In 1973, the hydroelectric plant of San Fiorano became operational (Lombardy).
In 1977, a thermoelectric power plant opened in Torre del Sale, near Piombino (Tuscany).
At the end of the 1970s the construction of thermal power plant of Porto Tolle began (Veneto). Its first completed section became active in 1980.
Between 1971 and 1977, the pilot 1000 kV transmission facilities in Suvereto (Tuscany) were tested.
Between 1973 and 1977, wells for the production of geothermal energy were drilled in Torre Alfina, in the province of Viterbo (Lazio).
In 1974, the construction work of the Adriatic high voltage electric backbone was completed.
The dam of Alto Gesso (Piedmont) was completed in 1982 as part of the hydroelectric power station Luigi Einaudi "Entracque".


=== 1980–1990: renouncing nuclear power ===
The 1980s was characterised by the construction of new plants and testing of alternative forms of energy, as well as a gradual reduction of oil reliance that went from 75.3% in 1973 to 58.5% by 1985.
In 1986, Enel had its first positive balance, with 14 billion and 100 million Italian liras gross profit.
Finally, in 1987, in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, the first referendum on nuclear power took place. This marked the end of nuclear power in Italy, the closing and suspension of all construction of nuclear power stations and the establishment of a new national energy plan.


==== New plants and alternative energy ====
In the same decade the following plants became active:
In 1983–84, the thermoelectric power plant of Fiumesanto (Sardinia) became active
In 1984–85, the pumped-storage hydroelectricity power station of Edolo (Lombardy), one of the biggest of its kind in Europe, became active
In 1984, the thermoelectric power plant of Torrevaldiagia Nord (Lazio) became active
With regards to alternative energy:
In 1981, with the help of the European Economic Community, Enel became the first company worldwide to build a solar power station (the Eurelios power station in Adrano, Sicily) and experimentally connect it to the main electricity grid (the plant was shut in 1987)
In 1984, the photovoltaic power station of Vulcano (Sicily) became active
In 1984, the first wind farm of the country became operational in Alta Nurra (Sardinia)
During 1985 the national center for the dispatch and control of the electricity network was gradually transferred from the center of Rome to Settebagni, and made a part of a bigger European network of synchronisation of the production of electricity.


==== Referendum, the closing of nuclear power plants and the new national energy plan ====

Following the Chernobyl disaster of 1987, a referendum sanctioned the interruption of all production of nuclear power in Italy. In relation to existing nuclear power plants or those that were under construction at the time:
The nuclear power station of Caorso (Emilia-Romagna), that had been inactive since 1986 due to refuelling, was never reactivated and was finally closed in 1990.
In 1987, the nuclear power station Enrico Fermi, in the village of Trino Vercelli (Piedmont) was deactivated – with all plans of a second plant cancelled. The plan was finally shut down in 1990.
In 1988 the work started in 1982 for the construction of the nuclear power station Alto Lazio, located in Montalto di Castro, were interrupted. In 1989 it was converted into a multi-fuel plant.
In 1988, the nuclear power station of Latina (Lazio) was shut down.
The nuclear power plant of Garigliano (Campania) had been shut down since 1978.
In 1988, the new National Energy Plan (PEN) established its key objectives as: increase energy efficiency; environmental protection; exploitation of national resources; diversification of supply sources from abroad; overall competitiveness of the production system.


=== 1990–2000: liberalisation and privatisation ===

Between 1990 and 2000, the country witnessed a progressive liberalisation of the electricity market.
In July 1992, the Amato I Cabinet turned Enel into a limited company with the Treasury as the sole shareholder.
In 1999, the Bersani Decree mark the beginning of the liberalisation of the electricity market; a corporate restructuring of Enel began, with the unbundling of the production, transmission, dispatch and sale of energy.


==== New plants and alternative energy ====
In 2000, Enel launched a project to connect Italy and Greece’s power grid by laying an underwater power line of 160 km length to connect Otranto (Apulia) with the Greek city of Aetos (Peloponnese) and capable of carrying 600 megawatts. The project, completed in 2002, had a total cost of 339 million euros.
With regards to alternative energy:
In 1993, Enel built the photovoltaic plant of Serre in the village of Persano (Campania) - at the time this was largest of its kind in Europe with an installed capacity of 3.3 megawatts.
In 1995, the wind farm of "Acquaspruzza" was built in Frosolone (Molise).
In 1998, Enel built the wind farm of Collarmele (Abruzzo).


==== Liberalisation, privatization and stock market launch ====
In 1991, Law No. 9/1991 sanctioned a first partial liberalization of the production of electricity generated from conventional sources and renewable sources; companies were allowed to produce electricity for their own use with the obligation to hand over the excess amount to Enel.
In 1999, the D'Alema I Cabinet issued the Legislative Decree no. 79 of 16 March 1999 – (known as the Bersani Decree) – to liberalise permanently the electricity sector. This opened up the possibility for other actors to operate in the energy market. Enel, that had so far been the only actor in the production, distribution and sale of electricity in Italy, had now to change its corporate structure by distinguishing the three phases and constituting three different companies: Enel Produzione, Enel Distribuzione and Terna (Terna was sold by Enel in 2005). Moreover, Enel was given a maximum threshold of electrical energy production equal to 50% of the entire production on national soil.
In 1999, 31.7% of the company – in its new structure – was privatised. Following privatization Enel was put on the stock market; its shares were listed on the Italian Stock Exchange with a value of 4.3 euro per share; the total supply was of 4.183 million shares for a total value of 18 billion euros.


==== Other operations ====
In 1997, Enel, France Télécom, and Deutsche Telekom funded Wind Telecomunicazioni as a joint venture, a mobile and fixed telecom operator.


=== 2000–2010: environmental policies and internationalization ===
During the 2000s, the company worked on policies to reduce the environmental impact of the production of energy and on a progressive internationalization of Enel through a number of mergers and acquisitions.


==== Environmental policies ====
In 2000, Enel signed an agreement with the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Industry in which the company committed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 13.5% before 2002, and by 20% before 2006.
In 2008, Enel formed Enel Green Power, a company dedicated to developing and managing the production of power from renewable sources.


==== Mergers and acquisitions ====
In 2000, Enel – through its subsidiary Erga – acquired CHI Energy, a renewable energy producer operating in the US and Canadian markets; the operation cost Enel $170 million.
In 2001, Enel won the tender offer for the purchase of Viesgo - a subsidiary of Endesa – a company active on the Spanish market in the production and distribution of electricity with a net installed capacity of 2400 MW.
In 2004, Enel was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, a stock market index that evaluates the financial performance of companies based on economic, environmental and social performance.
In 2002, Enel divested Eurogen SpA, Elettrogen SpA and Interpower SpA in compliance with the Bersani Decree provisions on the liberalization of the electricity production.


==== New plants and alternative energy ====
In 2001, Enel began the construction of a 1095 km long high-voltage transmission line in Brazil.
In 2009, Enel launched the Archilede project: a new urban lighting system chosen by 1600 municipalities. This new intelligent lighting technology resulted in approximately 26 GWh per year of energy saving, and reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 18,000 tons per year.
In 2009, Enel opened a new photovoltaic power station in the Park of Villa Demidoff in Pratolino (Florence).The project - called "Diamante" – was that of a plant capable of storing enough of the energy accumulated during the day in the form of hydrogen and use it during the night hours.
In 2010, the Archimede solar power plant became operational at Priolo Gargallo, near Syracuse in Sicily. This was the first solar power plant to use molten salt technology integrated with a combined cycle gas facility.


==== Other operations ====
In 2001, Enel acquired Infostrada – previously property of Vodafone; the cost of the operation was of 7.25 billion euro. Infostrada was later on merged with Wind Telecom (17 million customers between fixed, mobile and Internet services).
In 2005, Enel assigned 62.75% (the remaining 37.25% was divested in 2006) of Wind to Weather Investments S.a.r.l., a company belonging to the Egyptian businessman Naguib Sawiris, at the time CEO of Orascom.


=== 2010–today ===
This period was marked by the appointment of a new Board of Directors, that defined the reorganisation of assets abroad and reducing the company’s debt as the company’s main priorities for the future.


==== Industrial activities ====
In 2011, Enel opened the first pilot carbon dioxide capture facility in the country, in the area of Brindisi in the existing power plant ENEL Federico II.
In 2011 - in Isernia in the region of Molise - Enel Distribuzione built its first Smart grid, a grid able to adjust effectively the two-way flow of electricity generated from renewable sources. The total investment for this project was of 10 million euro.
In 2012 Enel and Renault - as part of e-mobility and Smart City - collaborated to manufacture a car model that would allow the customer to locate in real-time the nearest Enel charging point and retrieve information on its availability. Enel had previously collaborated with other car manufacturers such as Opel, Mercedes and Piaggio.


==== Corporate activities ====
In 2012 Enel sold the remaining 5.1% of Terna which was still in its possession, thus exiting completely the high-voltage market.
In 2013 Enel signed an agreement, in Sochi, for the sale of 40% of Artic Russia, a joint venture with Eni, which in turn controlled 49% of SeverEnergia, for $1.8 billion.
In May 2014, Maria Patrizia Grieco was elected president of the Board of Directors and Francesco Starace was appointed CEO. The main objectives were set to be the reorganisation of activities in Iberia and Latin America and debt reduction.


==== Research and development activities ====

== Controversies ==


=== Osage Wind LLC ===
On 11 November 2014, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Oklahoma filed suit against Enel's subsidiary. Osage Wind LLC, an 84-turbine industrial wind project in Osage County, Okla. In the suit, the United States alleges that Enel and Osage Wind are illegally converting minerals owned by the Osage Nation, a Native American tribe that has owned all mineral rights in the county since 1871. The suit says that Osage Wind should have obtained a permit from the Bureau of Indian Affairs before mining rock and other material for the pits in which turbine bases are built. The United States asked that all excavating on the 8,500 acre site cease and that dozens of turbines that are already being erected be removed. Osage Wind has insisted that it is not mining and needs no permit. The company says that it has already spent nearly $300 million on the project, which is being built on privately owned fee land, not land held in trust for American Indians.
Osage Wind LLC and a second and adjacent Enel wind project, Mustang Run, are also embroiled in challenges pending before the Oklahoma Supreme Court in which the Osage Nation and Osage County, Okla., are challenging the constitutional legitimacy of permits for both projects.


=== El Salvador ===
The company had to exit El Salvador electricity market after a long dispute with the Government of El Salvador [1]. The constitution of El Salvador (Art 109) states that the natural resources (underground) are the country's property and the government would not allow foreign companies to be the sole proprietor of the geothermic generation. Both parties came to a settlement in 2014, but no details have been released.
Another setback for Enel has been the recent loss it had with the government of Slovakia where it had been demanding over EUR 94 million from the Ministry of Economy in compensation for lost earnings it claims to have incurred as price proposals were rejected by utilities regulator URSO.
