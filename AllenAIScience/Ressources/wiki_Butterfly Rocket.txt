Butterfly Rocket is Nikka Costa's fourth studio record and first "adult" album, released in 1996 in Australia on Mushroom Records. It marks a drastic direction change from her previous releases, from pop to a mixture of blues, classic rock and hard rock. It is Costa's only release on Mushroom. The album is currently out of print and no re-release date has been scheduled, although Nikka Costa still performs live the songs "Grab Hold" and "Who's Loving You", as well as the b-side track "When My Man Cries".
