The Constitution of North Dakota is the most basic legal document in the U.S. State of North Dakota. It consists of a preamble and thirteen articles.
Amendments to the North Dakota Constitution have always required the approval of a majority of voters. Between 1889 and 1914, the power to propose amendments to the Constitution rested with the North Dakota Legislative Assembly. In 1914, the voter constitutional initiative was introduced; between 1914 and 2012, 74 initiated amendments were considered by North Dakota voters.
North Dakota's constitution was amended in 2012 to legally mandate the administration of oaths to state officers.
