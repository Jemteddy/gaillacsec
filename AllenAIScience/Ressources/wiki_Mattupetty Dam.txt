Mattupetty Dam, near Munnar in Idukki District, is a storage Concrete Gravity dam built in the mountains of Kerala, India to conserve water for hydroelectricity. It has been a vital source of power, yielding along with other such dams, huge revenue to the states. The large amount of perennially available water allows wild animals and birds to flourish. However salinity caused by irrigation and water-logging are of concern to environmentalists.
Munnar is located near the confluence of the mountain streams of Muthirappuzha River, Chanduvarai River and Kundale River. See:map
The reservoir is also known to be one of the visiting grounds of elephants in the region.
