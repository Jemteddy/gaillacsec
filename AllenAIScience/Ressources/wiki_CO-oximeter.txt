A CO-oximeter is a device that measures the oxygen carrying state of hemoglobin in a blood specimen. Co-oximetry is useful in defining the causes for hypoxemia, hypoxia, or oxygen deficiency at the tissue level.
The test is done with a device that measures absorption at several wavelengths to distinguish oxyhemoglobin from carboxyhemoglobin and determine the oxyhemoglobin saturation: the percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin compared to the total amount of hemoglobin (Hb), including carboxyhemoglobin (carboxy-Hb), methemoglobin (met-Hb), oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb), and reduced hemoglobin (reduced Hb). When a patient presents with carbon monoxide poisoning (CO), the CO-oximeter will detect the levels of each hemoglobin and will report the oxyhemoglobin saturation as markedly reduced.

Traditionally, this measurement is made from arterial blood processed in a blood gas analyzer with a CO-oximeter. More recently, pulse CO-oximeters have made it possible to estimate carboxyhemoglobin with non-invasive technology similar to a pulse oximeter. In contrast, the use of a standard pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of CO poisoning as patients suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation reading on a pulse oximeter.
