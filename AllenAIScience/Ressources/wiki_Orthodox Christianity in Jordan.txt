Orthodox Christianity in Jordan refers to adherents of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Jordan, which is a long-established part of Christianity in Jordan. It includes Greek Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox Church and Church of Antioch minorities. The Jordanian Greek Orthodox Christians are believed to be 120,000, most of whom are Arabic speaking. There are currently 29 Greek Orthodox churches – with that number on the increase – which come under the Jerusalem Patriarchate.  Most of the Greek Orthodox Christians live in Amman and surrounding areas.  The Greek Orthodox church has become known in the past for its pan-Arab orientation, possibly because it exists in various parts of the Arab world. Converts from Islam to Christianity risk the loss of civil rights. Christmas and the Gregorian calendar New Year are recognized holidays in Jordan.
