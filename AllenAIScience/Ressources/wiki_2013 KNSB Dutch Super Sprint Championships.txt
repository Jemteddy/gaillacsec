The 2013 KNSB Dutch Super Sprint Championships in speed skating were held at De Uithof Den Haag at 2 February 2013. It was the 23rd edition of this championships.
The seniors and the juniors in category A skate a combination, called "pure sprint", over the distances 100m, 300m and 500m. The juniors in category B and C skate a combination, called "supersprint", over the distances 2x100m and 2x300m. The resulting times have been measured in seconds and then converted to points, using the average times on 100 meter units; thus the number of points for a 300 meters race is the time in seconds divided by three; for the 500 meters, the time in seconds is divided by five. Points are calculated to three decimal places and truncation is applied; the numbers are not rounded. All points are added up; the lower the score the better.
