Fury and Hecla Strait is a narrow (from 2 to 20 km) channel of water located in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada. Situated between Baffin Island to the north and the Melville Peninsula to the south, it connects Foxe Basin on the east with the Gulf of Boothia on the west.
The first European to see it was William Edward Parry in 1822. It is almost always covered in ice, making the navigation difficult. The first transit was by icebreaker in the middle of the twentieth century.
The Strait is named after the Royal Navy ships HMS Fury and HMS Hecla, which found it; the former vessel was commanded by Parry.
