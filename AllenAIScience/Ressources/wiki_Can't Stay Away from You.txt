"Can't Stay Away from You" is the title of a 1988 single by singer Gloria Estefan, credited to Estefan and her former band, the Miami Sound Machine. The song was the third single released from their multi-platinum album, Let It Loose. It became Estefan's (and her band's) fifth Top 10 hit in the United States, peaking at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; it was their second #1 hit on the adult contemporary chart, following 1986's "Words Get in the Way". The song originally peaked at #88 on the UK Singles Chart in May 1988, however the song was re-released after the success of its follow-up, "Anything for You", peaking at #7 in March 1989.
The song is a pensive ballad sung from the perspective of a woman who is in love with someone who doesn't feel the same, but she is unwilling to walk away from their relationship because she does not want it to end.
The European CD single contains as a bonus cut a remixed version of "Surrender", an album cut from "Let It Loose", which Estefan performed on "Solid Gold".
Popular Latin singer Jaci Velasquez recorded a Spanish version of the song called "Mi Vida No Es Nada Sin Ti" for her album Milagro.
