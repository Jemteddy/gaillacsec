Kamehameha I established the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1795 after conquering most of the Hawaiian archipelago. In 1810, Kaumualii became a vassal of Kamehameha I, who therefore emerged as the sole sovereign of the island chain of Hawaiʻi. His dynasty lasted until 1872, and Kingdom of Hawaii lasted until 1893, when Queen Liliuokalani, of the Kalākaua Dynasty, was deposed by a pro-United States led overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. November 23, 1993, the Congress passed Public Law 103-150, also known as the Apology Resolution acknowledging the American role in the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. President Bill Clinton signed the joint resolution the same day.
