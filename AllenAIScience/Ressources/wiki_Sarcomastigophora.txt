The phylum Sarcomastigophora belongs to the Protista or protoctista kingdom and it includes many unicellular or colonial, autotrophic, or heterotrophic organisms.


== Taxonomy ==
It is divided into three subphyla: the Mastigophora, the Sarcodina and the Opalinata.
It is polyphyletic, and it is not a universally recognized classification. It places great significance upon method of locomotion in generating the taxonomy.
It can be described either as:
kingdom Protista → phylum Sarcomastigophora
or in older classifications as
phylum Protozoa → subphylum Sarcomastigophora.


== Name ==
It gets its name from the combination of "Sarcodina" (which is an older term used for amoeboids) and "Mastigophora" (which is an older term for flagellates).
