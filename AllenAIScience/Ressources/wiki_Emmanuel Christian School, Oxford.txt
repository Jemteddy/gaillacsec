Emmanuel Christian School (or ECS) is a private primary school in Littlemore, Oxford, England, founded in 1988.


== Aims and values ==
ECS is a small school based on Christian values. It is non-denominational in practice and policy.
The school employs a system of prefects for which year 5 and 6 students work upon good behaviour and etiquette to be given a prefect badge, which entitles the prefect to use the upper rooms of the Manor House lodge before lessons.


== Prefect system ==
The school operates a prefect system in which the teachers of the school have a meeting and decide the most suitable candidates. The prefect badge is an heraldic shield lined with gold and yellow.


== Motto, logo, and descriptions ==
Emmanuel means "God is With Us" (Matthew, Chapter 1, verse 23). The tree symbol references Psalm 1: "Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked... his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers."
The Logo is a golden 'E' in front of an English Oak surrounded by the name of Emmanuel Christian School, Oxford.
Descriptions of the school's Christian nature, vision, mission, and doctrinal basis are also linked there.
