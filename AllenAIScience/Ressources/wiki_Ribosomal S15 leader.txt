The E. coli ribosomal S15 leader is an RNA element that can form two alternative structures found in the ribosomal S15 protein. One of the two alternate structures is a series of three hairpins, the other includes a pseudoknot. This structure causes translational regulation of the S15 protein. Only the final two hairpins are conserved in other species.
