Christy: A Change of Seasons (also known as Christy, Choices of the Heart, Part I) is a 2001 made-for-tv movie developed for television by executive producer Tom Blomquist and starring Lauren Lee Smith, Stewart Finlay-McLennan, James Waterston, Diane Ladd, Dale Dickey, Andy Stahl, and Bruce McKinnon.
Written by Philip Gerson, A Change of Seasons was the second of three "Christy" movies, and the first of a two-part series entitled Christy: Choices of the Heart. The storyline was an adaptation of a section of the novel that was not presented in the original CBS series: the typhoid epidemic that took the life of a popular character, Fairlight Spencer.
