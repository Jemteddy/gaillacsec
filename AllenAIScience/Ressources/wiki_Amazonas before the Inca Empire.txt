Prehistoric evidence on rocky walls includes the rock paintings of Chiñuña-Yamón and Limones-Calpón in the province of Utcubamba. Some of these haughty pictorial samples were made by people who had a hunting economy 6 or 7 thousand years ago.
By the time the Peruvian civilization was already formed, there appeared a type of ceramics mainly identified in Bagua.
