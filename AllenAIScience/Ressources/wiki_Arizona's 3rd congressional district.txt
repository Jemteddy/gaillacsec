Arizona's 3rd congressional district is a congressional district that contains the southwestern portions of the state, sharing the border of Mexico from Nogales to the California border. Most of the district's population lives in the western third of Tucson. It is currently represented by Democrat Ra√∫l Grijalva.
From 2003 to 2013, the district contained most of the northern portion of Phoenix as well as some of its northern suburbs. Most of that territory is now the 6th District. Most of the territory currently in the 3rd had been the 7th District.

From 2003 to 2013, most of the district's population was in middle-to-upper class areas in the northern part of Phoenix. Like the metropolitan area in general, the 3rd district leaned Republican, although the southern parts of the district in east-central Phoenix and Paradise Valley were more competitive between the parties.
George W. Bush received 58% of the vote in this district in 2004. John McCain took in 56.47% of the vote in the district in 2008 while Barack Obama received 42.34%.
