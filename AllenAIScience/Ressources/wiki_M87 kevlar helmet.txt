The M87 is a combat helmet of South African origin manufactured by South African Pith Helmet Industries (S.A.P.H.I) of Rosslyn. The M87 replaced the steel M63 helmet during the late 1980s, and saw extensive use during the South African Border War, which took place from 1966 to 1989 in South-West Africa. It is the current standard helmet of the South African National Defence Force.
