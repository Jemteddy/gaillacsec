Underneath the Radar is the debut album by Underworld, released in 1988 (see 1988 in music). The album was a success in both Australia and the US (where it reached #139 on the Billboard 200). The title track of the album was released as a single which reached top five on the ARIA singles charts and number seventy-four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.
The album was recorded in one continuous single take and was promoted as such to underscore the technical expertise of the band members. Promotional appearances for the album's release featured the band playing the entire album live and in sequence.
