The Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge is a National Wildlife Refuge of the United States located in northern California near the Oregon border. It covers 39,116 acres in the Tule Lake basin.
The refuge was established in 1928 by President Calvin Coolidge to preserve habitat for birds and other animals. It is a staging area for migrating waterfowl such as the greater white-fronted goose, snow goose, Ross's goose, and cackling goose. The waterways of the refuge are inhabited by endangered fish species such as the Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker.
Local habitat types include uplands vegetated with grasses and shrubs such as sagebrush, and wetlands such as marshes. The refuge also includes about 19,000 acres of cropland leased to growers. Crops include potato, onion, horseradish, alfalfa, and cereals.
Recreation opportunities and public services include wildlife viewing and photography, education, and hunting.
