Metamorphosis Music is an American record label owned by Capitol Records and founded in 2014 by singer Katy Perry.


== History ==
Perry first announced plans to launch her own label in June 2012. She spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about how the label will be managed: "When this record label does come to fruition, I'm going to try and avoid the things that take away any fighting chance for an artist to have financial success. As people are coming to me with opportunities, I'm thinking, 'How would I want to be treated?'" On June 17, 2014, Perry announced via Twitter that she had launched Metamorphosis Music as a subsidiary of Capitol Records. The label's logo was revealed later that day.
