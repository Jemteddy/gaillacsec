CoasterDynamix is a United States manufacturer of realistic roller coaster models. Modeling kits are available in both O(1:48) and HO (1:87) scales. The company currently has 4 modeling kits; two designs in O scale based on Bolliger & Mabillard's inverted roller coaster and a traditional wooden roller coaster along with two designs in HO scale.
All kits are fully functional and most allow complete customization. Beginning in 2007, Statix coaster trains were made available for the O scale inverted kits. Statix models feature fully detailed trains with a section of display track to match various coaster types such as B&M hyper, dive and floorless.There are also non-functional Intamin & wood coaster Statix. These are available at a few theme parks, in addition to the company's online store. Released in 2011, the new O scale Comet and Big Dipper feature custom trains, wood structures, and the ability to customize. However, they are expensive. The new trains can run on any non-inverting track if you want a 2 rider per row coaster.


== Models ==


=== Dragon ===
The Dragon is an O scale model of a B&M inverted roller coaster. Released in 2003 the Dragon is 0.6m in length, 1.8m in width, and 0.9m tall .
The standard layout begins with an electric powered lift hill, the train then leaves the lift and pushes through 3 inversions; a vertical loop and a cobra roll. Two camel hump hills and an upwards helix comprise the second half of the layout after the inversions.


=== Scorpion ===

The Scorpion is an O scale model of a B&M inverted roller coaster. Similar to the Dragon however with less parts (shorter track and smaller lift hill), recoloured and styled train, and less expensive. The Scorpion caters for those who do not have the space required to display the Dragon or those whom simply aren't wishing to pay a large amount of money.
The standard layout of the Scorpion has 4 inversions, they are in order from start to finish; a vertical loop, dive loop, and 2 corkscrews.


=== Assembly ===
Both Dragon and Scorpion kits feature plastic track and supports that closely resemble the designs found on today's steel coasters. The pieces snap together which allow for custom designs to be built, although it is recommended that the layout provided is built first. The track and trains can be painted, but it is essential that the wheels and rails remain clean for optimum performance.


=== Functionality ===
Functionality is added to both models via an electric powered lift hill, running on a 12v adapter. The lift carries the train to the highest point of the model using a motor, a small fan belt and a spring to grip the train. The model then disengages the lift spring as it is pushed through a steep drop gaining a massive increase in acceleration. The train then navigates around the rest of the circuit and back to the lift hill by the force of gravity alone. In the event that the layout of the model is too large to be undertaken by the speed gained from the drop, the train will simply stop in the valley or rollback.


=== Comet ===
The Comet is a working HO scale model of a wooden roller coaster. It features a double oval layout with curved station, and trains that mimic those found on wooden coasters built around 1940-1960. The base measures 12" x 28". The structure is pre-colored and requires some glue for assembly. Experienced modelers should be able to modify it to create their own designs. There is now a new O scale Comet which retails at the CD website for $499.99USD. There is also a Big Dipper model that retails for 599.99USD.


=== Phoenix ===
The Phoenix is the new B&M sitdown kit from CoasterDynamix. It features new lift components, new supports, new bases and new colours. Unlike older kits, the Phoenix uses a combination of flexible and rigid track. It also has a station platform which includes restraint openers & closers, and an auto dispatch button. The kit retails for 149.99USD. http://www.coasterdynamix.com/gallery.aspx?album=16&item=388
