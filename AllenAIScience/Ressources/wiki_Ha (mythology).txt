Ha, in ancient Egypt, was a god of the deserts to the west of Egypt. He was associated with the underworld (Duat) and pictured as a man wearing the symbol for desert hills on his head. Ha was said to protect Egypt from enemies such as invading tribes from Libya.
The dinosaur Hagryphus ("Ha's griffin") was named after Ha; it was discovered in Utah and Ha's association with "the Western Desert" was carried over to the New World.
