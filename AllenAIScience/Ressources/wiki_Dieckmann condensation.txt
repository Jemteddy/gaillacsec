The Dieckmann condensation is the intramolecular chemical reaction of diesters with base to give β-ketoesters. It is named after the German chemist Walter Dieckmann (1869–1925). The equivalent intermolecular reaction is the Claisen condensation.


== Reaction Mechanism ==
The acidic hydrogen between the two carbonyl groups is deprotonated in step four. Protonation with a Brønsted-Lowry acid (H3O+ for example) re-forms the β-keto ester. This deprotonation step is the driving force for this reaction.

Owing to the steric stability of five- and six-membered ring structures, these will preferentially be formed. 1,4- and 1,6 diesters will form five-membered cyclic β-keto esters, while 1,5- and 1,7 diesters will form six-membered β-keto esters.
