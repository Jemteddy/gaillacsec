Denmark generally uses an eight digit closed telephone numbering plan. Subscriber numbers are portable with respect to provider and geography, i.e. fixed line numbers can be ported to any physical address in Denmark.


== Numbering ==
Split charge is not generally used in Denmark anymore; calls to 70 numbers are usually charged as regular landline calls. A few exceptions do exist, e.g., 70 10 11 55 (the TDC speaking clock service).


== Special numbers ==
Emergency (Police, Fire, Ambulance): 112
Police (non-emergency (Nearest physically Police Station, if calling from landline, Copenhagen Police Headquarters, if calling from mobile phone)): 114
Other 3 digit short codes are reserved.
Carrier select codes: 10xx
Service numbers (such as directory enquiries): 18xx
Carrier select codes for data: 16xxx
Social services: 116xxx
