X-box binding protein 1, also known as XBP1, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the XBP1 gene. The XBP1 gene is located on chromosome 22 while a closely related pseudogene has been identified and localized to chromosome 5. The XBP1 protein is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes important to the proper functioning of the immune system and in the cellular stress response.


== Discovery ==
The X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) is a transcription factor containing a bZIP domain. It was first identified by its ability to bind to the Xbox, a conserved transcriptional element in the promoter of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR alpha.


== Function ==


=== MHC class II gene regulation ===
The expression of this protein is required for the transcription of a subset of class II major histocompatibility genes. Furthermore, Xbp1 heterodimerizes with other bZIP transcription factors such as c-fos.
Xbp1 expression is controlled by the cytokine IL-4 and the antibody IGHM. Xbp1 in turn controls the expression of IL-6 which promotes plasma cell growth and of immunoglobulins in B lymphocytes.


=== Plasma cell differentiation ===
XBP-1 is also essential for differentiation of plasma cells (a type of antibody secreting immune cell). This differentiation requires not only the expression of XBP-1 but the expression of the spliced isoform of XBP-1s. XBP-1 regulates plasma cell differentiation independent of its known functions in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (see below). Without normal expression of XBP-1, two important plasma cell differentiation-related genes, IRF4 and Blimp1, are misregulated, and XBP-1-lacking plasma cells fail to colonize their long-lived niches in the bone marrow and to sustain antibody secretion.


=== Viral replication ===
This protein has also been identified as a cellular transcription factor that binds to an enhancer in the promoter of the T cell leukemia virus type 1 promoter. The generation of XBP-1s during plasma cell differentiation also seems to be the cue for Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Epstein Barr virus reactivation from latency.


=== Endoplasmic reticulum stress response ===
XBP-1 is part of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, the unfolded protein response (UPR). Conditions that exceed capacity of the ER provoke ER stress and trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR). As a result, GRP78 is released from IRE1 to support protein folding. IRE1 oligomerises and activates its ribonuclease domain through auto (self) phosphorylation. Activated IRE1 catalyses the excision of a 26 nucleotide unconventional intron from ubiquitously expressed XBP-1u mRNA, in a manner mechanistically similar to pre-tRNA splicing. Removal of this intron causes a frame shift in the XBP-1 coding sequence resulting in the translation of a 376 amino acid, 54 kDa, XBP-1s isoform rather than the 261 amino acid, 33 kDa, XBP-1u isoform. Moreover, the XBP-1u/XBP-1s ratio (XBP-1-unspliced/xbp-1-spliced ratio) correlates with the expression level of expressed proteins in order to adapt the folding capacity of the ER to the respective requirements.


== Clinical significance ==
Abnormalities in XBP1 lead to a heightened ER stress and subsequently causes a heightened susceptibility for inflammatory processes that may contribute to Alzheimer's disease. In the colon, XBP1 anomalies have been linked to Crohn's disease.
A single nucleotide polymorphism, C-116G, in the promoter region of XBP1 has been examined for possible associations with personality traits. None were found.


== Interactions ==
XBP1 has been shown to interact with estrogen receptor alpha.
