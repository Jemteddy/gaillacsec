Taxus x media, more commonly known as the Anglojap yew or simply Taxus media, is a conifer (more specifically, a yew) created by the hybridization of yew species Taxus baccata and Taxus cuspidata. This hybridization was thought to have been performed by the Massachusetts-based horticulturalist T.D. Hatfield in the early 1900s.


== Taxonomy and common naming ==
The T. Media ("Anglojap") yew is a hybrid between Taxus baccata and Taxus cuspidata. The common name Anglojap is a portmanteau stemming from the national origin of T. baccata (a species native to England) and the national origin of T. cuspidata (a species native to Japan).


== Description ==
Like most yew species, T. media prefers well-drained and well-watered soils, but has some degree of drought tolerance and in fact may die in conditions of excessive precipitation if the soil beneath the plant is not sufficiently well-drained.
T. media is among the smallest extant species in the genus Taxus and (depending upon cultivar) may not even grow to the size of what one would consider a typical tree. Immature shrubs are very small and achieve (over the time span of ten to twenty years) heights of at most 20 feet and diameters of at most 8 feet, depending on the cultivar. Furthermore, T. media is known to grow rather slowly and is not injured by frequent pruning, making this hybrid a very desirable as a hedge in low-maintenance landscaping and also a good candidate for bonsai.


== Toxicity ==
T. media also shares with its fellow yew trees a high level of taxine in its branches, needles, and seeds. Taxine is toxic to the mammalian heart.


== Varieties (Cultivars) ==
T. Media var. hicksii (also known by the common name Hicks's Yew or alternately, Hicks Yew) is a common cultivar of this hybrid, and is the tallest and thinnest variety of T. media, limiting itself to a 4 foot (1.3 meter) diameter despite the fact it can achieve a height of close to 20 feet.
Another commonly-planted cultivar of T. Media is the broader-spreading densiformis version, which can reach a diameter exceeding 10 feet; nonetheless, this cultivar does not grow much past 5 feet in height.
