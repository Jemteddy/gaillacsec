Sam's Choice is a private label brand created by Cott Beverages for Wal-Mart discount stores, supercenters, and neighborhood markets. The brand was introduced as "Sam's American Choice" in 1991 and has since been shortened to simply "Sam's Choice". It is named after Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart. Items produced under the Sam's Choice label primarily are grocery items.
Wal-Mart also markets a type of carbonated water similar to soda under the Sam's American Choice label, although the word American has been phased out. Called "Clear American", it comes in a variety of fruit flavors (such as Black Cherry and Key Lime). Its name was derived from (but is unrelated to) a popular non-Wal-Mart brand called Clearly Canadian, the historical market leader in the sparkling water segment.
More recently, the brand has expanded from mainly beverages to several other items. Recent additions include Sam's Choice coffee and Sam's Choice Black Angus hamburger patties as well as Sam's Choice pizzas.
It should also be noted that Wal-Mart has another "Sam's Choice" type company of its own under the name Great Value, which caters to a number of different products ranging from bleach to beef jerky.
