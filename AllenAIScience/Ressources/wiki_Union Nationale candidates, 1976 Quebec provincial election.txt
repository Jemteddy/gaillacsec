=== Brome—Missisquoi, April 13, 1980: Pierre-Paul Ravenelle ===
Pierre-Paul Ravenelle was a Parti Québécois (PQ) member in the 1970s. He later left the PQ, arguing that it was ignoring its grassroots supporters. He added that Quebec separatism was never his primary ambition, even when he was a member of the party.
He was a reluctant Union Nationale candidate in 1980, running only when no other party members stepped forward. He received 1,909 votes (8.98%), finishing third against Liberal Party candidate Pierre Paradis.
Ravenelle served as mayor of Bedford from April to November 1987.
