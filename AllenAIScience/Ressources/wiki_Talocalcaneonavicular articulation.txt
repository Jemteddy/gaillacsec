The talocalcaneonavicular articulation is a ball and socket joint: the rounded head of the talus being received into the concavity formed by the posterior surface of the navicular, the anterior articular surface of the calcaneus, and the upper surface of the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament.
There are two ligaments in this joint: the articular capsule and the dorsal talonavicular.
