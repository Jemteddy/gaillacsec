Brain Research is a peer-reviewed scientific journal focusing on several aspects of neuroscience. It publishes research reports and "minireviews". The editor-in-chief is Irwin B. Levitan.
Until 2011, full reviews were published in Brain Research Reviews, which is now integrated into the main section, albeit with independent volume numbering. In 2006, four other previously established semi-independent journal sections (Cognitive Brain Research, Developmental Brain Research, Molecular Brain Research, and Brain Research Protocols) were merged with Brain Research.
The journal has nine main subsections:
Cellular and Molecular Biology of Nervous Systems
Nervous System Development, Regeneration and Aging
Neurophysiology, Neuropharmacology and other forms of Intercellular Communication
Structural Organization of the Brain
Sensory and Motor Systems
Regulatory Systems
Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience
Disease-Related Neuroscience
Computational and Theoretical Neuroscience
