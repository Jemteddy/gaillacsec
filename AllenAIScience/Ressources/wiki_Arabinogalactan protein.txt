== Arabinogalactan protein (AGPs) ==
Arabinogalactan protein is a broad term applied to diverse class of cell surface glycoproteins present in plant cell walls. It is heavily glycosylated, with only 2-10% comprising the protein region.The protein family has been earlier reported to contain O-linked glycans, whereas recent efforts employing mass spectrometry have revealed the presence of N-linked glycans as well within this protein family isolated from elongating cotton fiber cells.


== Structure of Arabinogalactan Protein (AGPs) ==
AGPs contains protein backbone of varied length (5-30kDa) with N-terminal secretory peptide followed by AGP, Fasciclin domains and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchor site. In some plant cells, the length of the mature protein backbone is only 10-13 residues long and they are therefore called as Arabinogalactan peptides. The protein backbone contains domain rich in hydroxyproline/proline, serine, alanine and glycine amino acids. The repeated occurrence of Alanine/Serine/Threonine-Proline stretch (glycomodules) and the presence of hydroxyproline suggests the sites for O-linked glycosylation and arabinogalactan modification. The O-linked glycan chains predominantly contain galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, mannose, galacturonic acid and/or glucuronic acids and have a relatively high degree of polymerization, with a structure similar to arabinogalactan II.


== Biological roles of AGPs ==
AGPs are known to be involved in many biological processes like cell division, cell elongation, cell death, pattern formation, maintenance of post embryonic pattern, vascular, gametophyte development, signalling, root-microbe interaction etc.
