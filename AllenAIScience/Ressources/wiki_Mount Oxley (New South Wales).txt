Mount Oxley (Aboriginal: Oombi Oombi) is a hill situated 32 kilometres (20 mi) from Bourke in the Far West region of New South Wales in outback Australia.
The hill appears as a mesa-like inselberg, rising 150 metres (490 ft) above the Western Plains. It is a small relic of a formerly large sedimentary rock formation, mostly now eroded away. The underlying and surrounding rocks are sedimentary sandstone and metamorphic quartzite.
The first European to visit the mountain was Charles Sturt in December 1828. He mentioned "a report as of a gun discharge" near Mount Oxley. He surmised "it might be some gaseous explosion".


== Etymology ==
Named after the explorer John Oxley, the mountain is known as Oombi Oombi to the Indigenous Australians. Archaeological evidence suggested that they quarried the area for grinding stones. Stones from Mount Oxley were highly regarded and expensive, and reportedly managed by indigenous elders.


== Flora and fanua ==
Plants growing here have adapted to the semi-arid climate. They include species of Acacia, the desert bloodwood, weeping pittosporum and leopardwood. Wildflowers of the daisy family are prominent after rain. Animals seen here include western grey kangaroo and feral goats. Wedge-tailed eagles are often seen flying above the mountain.


== Geology ==
A number of small crater-like rocky formations may be seen in two distinct lines on the top part of the hill. There is ongoing speculation regarding their formation. The most likely explanation for the explosions and craters is geological. Other theories include meteors, evil spirits, omens, artillery, animals or unidentified human activity. Charles Sturt also described similar small rocky hollows near the top of Oxley Range located about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) north northeast of Mount Oxley.
Mount Oxley has been mooted as a site for a seven-turbine 18 megawatts (24,000 hp) wind farm.
