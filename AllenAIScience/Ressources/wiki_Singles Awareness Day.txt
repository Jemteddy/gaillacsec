"Singles Awareness (or Appreciation) Day" (S.A.D.) is a humorous holiday, celebrated for single people (although some prefer to celebrate it for couples). It serves as an alternative to Valentine's Day for people who are single, that is, not involved in a romantic relationship. Some people who observe S.A.D. do so out of spite for Valentine's Day, as a Hallmark holiday, or for other reasons. 
On Singles Awareness Day, single people gather to celebrate or to commiserate in their single status. Some want to remind romantic couples that they don't need to be in a relationship to celebrate life. 
Common activities during Singles Awareness Day include, single events, traveling, volunteering, treating oneself to popular activities, gathering of family and friends, and gift giving for oneself. One increasingly popular activity is to travel to Brazil and witness the Brazilian Carnival, coupled with the fact that Brazil doesn't celebrate Valentine's Day on February 14, but in June. Both factors provide a temporary getaway from the Valentine's holiday and substitute it with another celebration. Another similar option is to celebrate Mardi Gras instead, which occurs around the same time as Valentine's Day.
On this day many people wear green, as it is the complementary opposite of red. Another popular option is an absence of color (black), to symbolize an absence of celebration.
