Synema globosum is a species of 'crab spiders' belonging to the family Thomisidae.
This species is present in most countries of Europe and in the eastern Palearctic ecozone. It is especially common throughout the Mediterranean region.

The adult males reach 2–4 millimetres (0.079–0.157 in) of length, while females are 7–8 millimetres (0.28–0.31 in) long. They can mostly be encountered from May through August on flowering plants (especially yellow or red Apiaceae species), waiting for their preys.
The two pairs of the front legs, used for hunting the flower-feeding insects, are more developed than the rear ones, which have a predominant motor function.
The main peculiarity of this species is the basic coloration of the abdomen, that can be red, orange, yellow or white, with a black pattern. Some people have found in these markings a certain resemblance to the silhouette of Napoleon.  Prosoma and legs are black or dark brown.
Like other species of the family Thomisidae these spiders do not make a web, but actively hunt their preys.
