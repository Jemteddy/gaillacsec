Spleen transplantation is the transfer of spleen or spleen fragments from one individual to another. It is under research for induction of immunological tolerance for other transplanted organs. Success has been achieved in rodent models. Recently, evidence has been obtained for a tolerogenic effect of a spleen transplant in miniature swine (Frank JMF Dor, PhD thesis). Also, the spleen harbors primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells. Spleen transplantation surgery has been performed on humans with mixed results.
