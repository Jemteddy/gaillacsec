Perimysium is a sheath of connective tissue that groups muscle fibers into bundles (anywhere between 10 to 100 or more) or fascicles.
Recent advances in muscle physiology suggest that the perimysium plays a role in transmitting lateral contractile movements. This hypothesis is strongly supported in one exhibition of the existence of "Perimysial Junctional Plates" in ungulate Flexor carpi radialis muscles constructed by E Passerieux. The overall comprehensive organization of the perimysium collagen network, as well as its continuity and disparateness, however, have still not been observed and described thoroughly everywhere within the muscle.
