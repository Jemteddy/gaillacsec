This is a list of countries and dependencies ranked by human population density and measured by the number of human inhabitants per square kilometer or square mile.


== MethodologyEdit ==
The list includes sovereign states and self-governing dependent territories based upon the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. The list also includes but does not rank unrecognized but de facto independent countries. The figures in the following table are based on areas including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).
Figures used in this article are mainly based on the latest censuses and official estimates (or projections). Where there is not such updated national data available, figures are based on the 2012 estimates provided by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

The names of dependent territories as well as recognized states with no or limited control over their territory are shown in italics.
