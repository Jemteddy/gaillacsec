Snowmobile studs are small metal projections added to the track of a snowmobile in order to increase traction and maneuverability and decrease stopping time and distance. They may be made from steel or stainless steel with carbide tips, and are designed for specific terrains in varying lengths, shapes and materials. However, the studs may do damage to asphalt roads and trails, and some communities have banned their usage.
