All of the Above is the second album of indie hip hop artist J-Live, released in 2002 on the label Coup d'Ã‰tat. The album's cover art pays homage/tribute to John Coltrane's famous cover design on his 1957 album Blue Train.
Josh Wells of HipHopDX said of the album: "There are virtually no weak tracks on 78 minutes of music. With deft production by DJ Spinna, Usef Dinero, Touch of Jazz and J himself, instead there are only standouts - many. 'How Real It Is' displays J over live instrumentation and sets the tone for the rest of the opus."
