Batrachology is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians including frogs and toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians. It is often studied as part of the wider discipline of herpetology which also covers reptiles, including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the tuataras.
Amphibians are cold blooded vertebrates largely found in damp habitats although many species have special behavioural adaptations that allow them to live in deserts, trees, underground and regions with wide seasonal variations in temperature. There are over 7250 species of amphibians.
