The Imaginary Direction of Time is the second full-length album by Norwegian progressive metal band Winds. It was released on July 26, 2004. Paul Stenning described the album in Terrorizer as lacking "any real sense of purpose. This seems like a 'concept' and 'avant garde' for the sake of it, turning the album into a mesh of clumsy comparisons and nothing of real worth...it's a none-too-daring experiment caught in the headlights of its own vision".
