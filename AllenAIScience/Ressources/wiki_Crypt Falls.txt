Crypt Falls is a waterfall in southwestern Alberta in Waterton Lakes National Park. It is viewable from the Crypt Lake Trail via ferry service from the Waterton town-site. It drops out of Crypt Lake and feeds a smaller lake below it. The true height of the fall is unknown but it is estimated to be taller than it currently is listed as.
