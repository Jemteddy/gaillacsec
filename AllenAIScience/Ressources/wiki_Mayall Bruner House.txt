The Mayall Bruner House is a historic house at 36 Magnolia Avenue in Newton, Massachusetts. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a complex roofline that includes two front facing gables. At the sides the gable roofs extend further downward, to garden gate on one side and the main entrance on the other. The entry is sheltered by a hip-roof portico with a segmented-arch opening. The house was built in 1923 to a design by noted Boston architect Arthur H. Bowditch. Mayall Bruner was a wool merchant with offices in Boston. The house is an excellent local example of rustic Craftsman styling.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
