"Divine" is a song by Sébastien Tellier from his 2008 album Sexuality. The song represented France at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. The song is in English, with a few verses in French. The fact that most of the song was sung in English caused some criticism, and has even been brought up in the French parliament.
Sébastien Tellier's performance was noted for entering the stage driving a small golf buggy branded with the French Tricolour, and carrying a helium filled inflatable globe that he inhaled from. Also, the five back-up singers wore sunglasses, wigs and fake facial hair, resembling Tellier.
The song automatically qualified for the final of the contest due to France being a member of the Big 4. The final was held on 24 May 2008, where the song was performed 19th in the running order, following the Ukraine's Ani Lorak with "Shady Lady" and preceding Azerbaijan's Elnur and Samir with "Day After Day". It received a total of 47 points, placing 19th in a field of 25.
Divine has been used in a Renault Mégane advert.
The song was succeeded as French representative at the 2009 contest by Patricia Kaas with "Et s'il fallait le faire".
