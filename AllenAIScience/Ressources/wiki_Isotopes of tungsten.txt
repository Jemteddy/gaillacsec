Naturally occurring tungsten (atomic symbol W) consists of five stable isotopes (182W, 183W, 184W, and 186W) and one isotope, 180W, with an extremely long half-life of 1.8 ± 0.2 Ea (1018 years). On average, two alpha decays of 180W occur per gram of natural tungsten per year.
33 artificial radioisotopes of tungsten have been characterized with mass numbers ranging from 157 to 194, the most stable of which are 181W with a half-life of 121.2 days, 185W with a half-life of 75.1 days, 188W with a half-life of 69.4 days and 178W with a half-life of 21.6 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 24 hours, and most of these have half-lives that are less than 8 minutes. Tungsten also has 11 meta states with mass numbers of 158, 179, with 3, 180, with 2, 183, 185, 186, with 2, and 190, the most stable being 179m1W (t1/2 6.4 minutes).
Standard atomic mass: 183.84(1) u

== Notes ==
Values marked # are not purely derived from experimental data, but at least partly from systematic trends. Spins with weak assignment arguments are enclosed in parentheses.
Uncertainties are given in concise form in parentheses after the corresponding last digits. Uncertainty values denote one standard deviation, except isotopic composition and standard atomic mass from IUPAC, which use expanded uncertainties.
