After the 2000 U.S. census, California gained one seat. The 2010 U.S. census, however, kept the state's apportionment at 53 seats.
In 2012, owing to a new reapportionment method, some incumbent members chose to run in differently numbered districts (typically within a similar geographic region, with some changing their residence) and owing to a new open primary system, some incumbents were placed against opponents of their own party in the general election. For details concerning these changes and the specific effects upon the 2012 election see Politics of California.
