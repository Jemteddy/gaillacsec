A hunting strategy, or hunting method, is for locating, targeting, and killing a targeted animal. Hunting methods have also been applied to situations such as the pursuit of fugitives by government agencies and the targeting of a small military unit by a larger one, especially during low intensity conflict.
Aggressive mimicry is when the hunter tricks the animal into thinking that they're also an animal in order to get closer. This is usually done by wearing an animal's skin and mimicing their usual behavior. This is a tactic seen in big game hunts among Native American peoples.
Baiting is the use of decoys, lures, scent or food to attract targeted animals.

Blind or Stand hunting is waiting for animals in a concealed or elevated position.
Calling is the use of noises to attract or drive animals.
Camouflage is concealing oneself visually, or with scent, to blend in with the environment.
Dogs may be used to help flush, herd, drive, track, point at, pursue, or retrieve animals.
Driving is the herding of animals in a particular direction, as over a cliff or to other hunters.
Flushing is the practice of scaring targets from concealed areas.
Glassing is the use of optical instruments (such as binoculars) to locate animals more easily.
Spotlighting is the use of artificial light to find or blind targets before capture. Modern lighting also includes IR and other devices.
Scouting consists of a variety of tasks and techniques for finding animals to hunt.
Stalking is the practice of walking stealthily, often in pursuit of an identified animal.
