"Hail Varsity" is a fight song of the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln, often played at football games by the University of Nebraska Cornhusker Marching Band. The band song is often played before playing Hail Varsity. The lyrics were written by Joyce Ayres, a 1930 Nebraska graduate, and the music was composed by Wilbur Chenoweth. There are three other fight songs, "Dear Old Nebraska U," "March of the Cornhuskers," and "The Cornhuskers (Come a Runnin' Boys)."
