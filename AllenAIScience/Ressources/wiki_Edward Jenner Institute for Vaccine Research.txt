The Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research was an independent research institute named after Edward Jenner, the inventor of vaccination. It was co-located with the Compton Laboratory of the Institute for Animal Health on a campus in the English village of Compton. After occupying temporary laboratory space at the Institute for Animal Health from 1996, the Institute moved to a newly completed laboratory building in 1998. Funding of the Institute continued until October 2005 when it was closed.
A successor institute, formed by a partnership between the University of Oxford and the UK Institute for Animal Health, was established in November 2005. This Jenner Institute is headquartered in Oxford and supported by a specific charity, the Jenner Vaccine Foundation.
