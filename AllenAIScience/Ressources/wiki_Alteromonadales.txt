The Alteromonadales are an order of Proteobacteria. Although they have been treated as a single family, the Alteromonadaceae, they were divided into eight by Ivanova et al. in 2004. The cells are straight or curved rods. They are motil by the use of a single flagellum. Most of the species are marine.
