Linear Scheduling Method (LSM) is a graphical scheduling method focusing on continuous resource utilization in repetitive activities. It is believed (see Harris and McCaffer 2006:79*) that it originally adopted the idea of Line-Of-Balance method.


== Application ==
LSM is used mainly in the construction industry to schedule resources in repetitive activities commonly found in highway, pipeline, high-rise building and rail construction projects. These projects are called repetitive or linear projects. The main advantages of LSM over Critical Path Method (CPM) is its underlying idea of keeping resources continuously at work. In other words, it schedules activities in such a way that:
resource utilization is maximized;
interruption in on-going process is minimized, including hiring-and-firing; and
the effect of the learning curve phenomenon is minimized


== Alternative names ==
According to, specific names for the linear scheduling method have been adopted, such as:
Location-based scheduling (the preferred term in the book)
Harmonograms
Line-of-balance
Flowline or flow line
Repetitive scheduling method
Vertical production method
Time-location matrix model
Time space scheduling method
Disturbance scheduling
Horizontal and vertical logic scheduling for multistory projects
Horizontal and vertical scheduling
Multiple repetitive construction process
Representing construction
Linear scheduling
Time versus distance diagrams (T-D charts)
Time chainage
Linear balance charts
Velocity diagrams
