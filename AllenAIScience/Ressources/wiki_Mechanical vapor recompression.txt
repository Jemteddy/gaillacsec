Mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) is an energy recovery process. It involves taking vapor (usually water vapor) at, or a little above, atmospheric pressure and adding energy to it by compression. The result is a smaller volume of vapor, at a higher temperature and pressure, which can be used to do useful work. 


== Applications ==


=== Current ===
Modern applications are chiefly to industrial processes such as evaporation and distillation. Heat from the condenser, which would otherwise be wasted, can be recovered and used in the evaporation process.


=== Past ===
MVR was used in the Cristiani compressed steam system for locomotive transmission. Although it was technically feasible, it failed to become popular because of its complexity.
