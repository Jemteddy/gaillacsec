This article lists the fastest recorded tennis serves in the men's and women's games. This list may not be historically complete. A serve by Bill Tilden in 1931 was timed at 262.8 km/h (163.3 mph), but this is not listed because of questionable technological accuracy.
Though the Association of Tennis Professionals does not formally recognize service speed records made in Challenger events due to the variance in radar guns; the serve of 263 km/h (163 mph) recorded by Australian Sam Groth at an ATP Challenger event in Busan, South Korea in May 2012 was measured using approved equipment, and other data gathered appeared within a normal range. Technically however, Ivo Karlovic still holds the official record for the fastest serve.
Criteria
Men's serves can be and must be recorded at or over 225 km/h (140 mph) minimum standard speed.
Women's serves must be recorded at or over 200 km/h (124 mph) minimum standard speed.
Only one serve per player is recorded here. For example, Andy Roddick has many 225 km/h (140 mph) or faster serves on his record but only his personal best of 249 km/h (155 mph) is included.
In cases where more than one serve has been recorded at the same speed, the oldest recorded serve is listed first.
