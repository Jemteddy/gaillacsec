BMS-955176 is an experimental HIV maturation inhibitor under development by Bristol-Myers Squibb for use in the treatment of HIV infection. By blocking the maturation of the virus, it prevents viral reproduction in host CD4+ T cells. Because it targets a different step of the viral lifecycle, it offers promise for individuals with virus that has become highly resistant to other classes of HIV drugs. Since this drug better handles naturally occurring changes in the Gag protease polyprotein, it is unlikely to promote resistance to itself unlike earlier maturation inhibitors.
