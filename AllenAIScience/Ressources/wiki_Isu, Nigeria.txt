Isu is a local government area in the Imo State of Nigeria. Its headquarters are in the town of Umundugba. Other communities are Amandugba, Ekwe, Uburu Ekwe, Isunjaba, Amurie Omanze, Ebenator Ekwe and Oboro Amurie. The name comes from the Isu people, a subgroup of the Igbo people.
Amandugba and neighboring Umundugba used to be one town. Both communities have suffered from an unreliable water supply from streams and brooks that often dry up, and that are breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes and sources of diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, guinea worm, tape worm, and night blindness. A recent project by Africa We Care, a charity, has started to develop a supply based on a bore-hole.
