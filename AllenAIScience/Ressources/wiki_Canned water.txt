Canned water is drinking water packaged in tin cans or beverage cans, a less common alternative to bottled water. Canned water is used primarily where storage or distribution systems are set up for cans, or when canning systems are used to make emergency water supplies.
Water was stored in steel cans, lined with plastic bags, under the United States Civil Defense program. Approximately twelve million 17.5-US-gallon (66 L) cans were deployed, and could hold water for more than ten years.
Later, some manufacturers (e. g. Blue Can Water) started to use aluminium cans. They do not deteriorate as quickly as steel cans, prolonging the shelf life to over 50 years, making it suitable for long term storage.
