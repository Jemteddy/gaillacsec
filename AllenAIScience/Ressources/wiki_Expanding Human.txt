== IntroductionEdit ==
A man experiments with consciousness expanding drugs and accidentally lets loose the monster inside himself.


== Opening narrationEdit ==
As far back as men have recorded their history, veils have been lowered to disclose a vast new reality — rents in the fabric of Man's awareness. And somewhere, in the endless search of the curious mind, lies the next vision, the next key to his infinite capacity...


== PlotEdit ==
Professor Peter Wayne is disturbed to hear that his university colleague, Dr. Roy Clinton, is pursuing forbidden drug experiments with a group of graduate students. When one of the students turns up dead, Professor Wayne investigates Clinton's activities, and discovers that consciousness-expansion can have powerful and dangerous consequences.


== Closing narrationEdit ==

"Some success, some failure, but either way the gnawing hunger to know is never sated, and the road to the unknown continues to be dark and strange."
