Ebonite International is a parent company that oversees the manufacture of bowling balls and bowling equipment. Their headquarters and primary manufacturing facility is located in Hopkinsville, Kentucky.


== Expansion in 2007 ==
In addition to Ebonite-branded bowling balls, Ebonite International also owns the Hammer-branded line of balls. In February 2007, Ebonite announced that it had acquired one of the industry's leading manufacturers, Columbia Industries. Since the acquisition, they have produced that company's signature Columbia 300 line of balls. That acquisition also resulted in Ebonite gaining control of Dynothane Inc., which produced the popular Dyno-Thane brand and Track International, which produced the popular line of Track bowling balls. Dynothane and Track had been owned by Columbia, and were transferred to Ebonite when the latter purchased the former.[1]
