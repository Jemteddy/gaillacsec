The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) is a non-profit organization in the United States established to provide the means to cure and control cystic fibrosis (CF). The Foundation provides information about cystic fibrosis and finances CF research that aims to improve the quality of life for people with the disease. The Foundation also engages in legislative lobbying for cystic fibrosis. **


== History ==
The Foundation was established in 1955 by a group of volunteers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In addition to providing grants for research into cystic fibrosis and supporting clinical trials, the foundation promotes and accredits 115 specialized centers for treatment of individuals with cystic fibrosis. The Foundation has over 80 chapters and offices across the US.
Before it began using the current name, the organization was known as the "National Cystic Fibrosis Research Foundation".
In 1989, scientists working for the Foundation discovered the gene that causes cystic fibrosis, considered the key to developing a cure for CF.
The Foundation has been a pioneer of CF treatment, having played a major role in the development and use of five FDA-approved therapies, including ivacaftor (Kalydeco).

Currently the Foundation operates out of Bethesda, Maryland. Preston Campbell, M.D. is the active president and CEO of the organization.
