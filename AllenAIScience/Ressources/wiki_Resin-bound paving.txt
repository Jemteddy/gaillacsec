Resin-bound paving is a mixture of aggregate stones and resin used to pave footpaths, driveways, etc. It is a kind of permeable paving solution.
It is a flexible surfacing material, so is resistant to cracking.
The system is mixed on site and cold applied, using a high-quality clear resin binder to coat the aggregate particles prior to laying. Unlike other methods of resin based surfacing, where a thin layer of resin is applied to the surface and then the aggregate scattered on top (which can then become loose over time and is impermeable), resin and aggregates are thoroughly mixed together prior to laying – ensuring that the aggregate is completely coated and so providing a totally bound surface. As a result, a resin bound surface is more durable and requires less maintenance – it needs to sweep or power wash the paving at least twice a year, to avoid the buildup of detritus and prevent the growth of moss or algae.
Resin bound paving is a fully permeable paving solution which allows water to freely drain through the surface. Meeting the requirements of Sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) standards, this helps to prevent standing water and largely eliminates surface water runoff.
