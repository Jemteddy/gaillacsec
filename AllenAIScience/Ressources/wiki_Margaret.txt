Margaret is a female first name, derived via French (Marguerite) and Latin (Margarita) from Greek Margarites, derived from the noun margaron meaning 'pearl'. The Greek is probably related to the Sanskrit मञ्जरी mañjarī meaning 'pearl' or 'cluster of blossoms.'
Margaret has been an English name since the 11th century, and remained popular throughout the Middle Ages. It became less popular between the 16th century and 18th century, but became more common again after this period, becoming the second most popular name in the United States in 1903. Since this time, it has become less common, but was still the ninth most common name for women of all ages in the United States as of the 1990 census.
Margaret has a large number of diminutive forms in many different languages.
