In human anatomy, the inguinal triangle is a region of the abdominal wall. It is also known by the eponym Hesselbach's triangle, after Franz Kaspar Hesselbach.


== Boundaries ==
It is defined by the following structures:
Medial border: Lateral margin of the rectus sheath, also called linea semilunaris
Superolateral border: Inferior epigastric vessels
Inferior border: Inguinal ligament, sometimes referred to as Poupart's ligament
This can be remembered by the mnemonic RIP (as direct inguinal hernias rip directly through the abdominal wall).


== Clinical significance ==
The inguinal triangle contains a depression referred to as the medial inguinal fossa, through which direct inguinal hernias protrude through the abdominal wall.
