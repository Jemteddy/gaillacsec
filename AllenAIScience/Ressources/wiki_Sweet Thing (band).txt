Sweet Thing was a Canadian alternative rock band based in Toronto who have been signed to EMI Music Canada since 2008. They are best known for their singles "Dance Mother" and "Change of Seasons".

== History ==
Band members are originally from Ottawa and Lindsay, Ontario, and Victoria, British Columbia. Bassist Morgan Waters, guitarist Nick Rose, and drummer Tyler Kyte all had acting careers in Canada prior to the formation of Sweet Thing. (Waters won two Gemini Awards for the television series Cock'd Gunns and one for The Morgan Waters Show.) The band took their name from the song by Van Morrison. They cite such influences as The Beatles, The Band, Stevie Wonder, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Michael Jackson, Sloan, and Ted Leo. They worked with producer Rob Schnapf (Elliott Smith, Beck) in Los Angeles for their debut album. Billboard wrote that the album "is full of chiming guitars and chugging rhythms, recalling other guitar-based groups searching for a danceable groove like Franz Ferdinand." Critic Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star wrote, " 'Lazy Susan' and 'Lorraine' prance like Spoon after a '70s soft-rock bender, while 'Winter Night' makes a run for the children-of-Coldplay club and succeeds with a smashingly universal and emotive girly-boy chorus."
Sweet Thing toured Canada in 2010 to promote their debut album.
