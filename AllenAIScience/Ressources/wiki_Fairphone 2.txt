The Fairphone 2 is a touchscreen-based, Dual SIM smartphone designed and manufactured by Fairphone. The Fairphone 2 is one of the first modular smartphones to be available for purchase with the product being designed to be easily opened and for key components such as the screen and USB ports to be replaced with no experience and only a small screwdriver - with experience almost all components are designed to be replaceable with only the microphones being soldered into place. It will be released running Android 5.1 though Fairphone is in discussions to enable other operating systems such as Sailfish OS or Firefox OS to be available. It is the second phone from the social enterprise Fairphone and the first one which they have completely designed. The initial batch of the device has been set for release in November 2015.
The phone is designed to have a lower environmental impact than comparable mass market smartphones. This is largely being achieved through a modular, repairable design to increase longevity and through a focus on increasing the recyclability of the product. Because of criticisms about the higher price of Fairphone 2 compared to Fairphone 1, the company released the detail of the costs.
The phone was primarily funded through pre-orders and is mostly being sold directly, though in some markets the phone is available through resellers such as The Phone Co-op in the UK.
