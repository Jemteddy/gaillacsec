James Ellis Colliander (born 22 June 1967) is an American Canadian mathematician. He is currently Professor of Mathematics at University of British Columbia and Founder/CEO of an education technology company called Crowdmark. He was born in El Paso, Texas and lived there until age 8 and then moved to Hastings, Minnesota. He graduated from Macalester College in 1989. He worked for two years at the United States Naval Research Laboratory on fiber optic sensors and then went to graduate school to study mathematics. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1997 and was advised by Jean Bourgain. Colliander was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley and spent semesters at the University of Chicago, the Institute for Advanced Study and the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute.
He is also an award winning teacher.


== Research ==
Colliander's research mostly addresses dynamical aspects of solutions of Hamiltonian partial differential equations, especially non-linear Schrödinger equation.
Colliander is a collaborator with Markus Keel, Gigliola Staffilani, Hideo Takaoka, and Terence Tao, forming a group known as the "I-team". The name of this group has been said to come from a mollification operator used in the team's method of almost conserved quantities, or as an abbreviation for "interaction", referring both to the teamwork of the group and to the interactions of light waves with each other. The group's work was featured in the 2006 Fields Medal citations for group member Tao.
