Mountains can be listed according to various criteria:
They can be part of peakbagging lists, which are goals for mountain climbers/hikers.
They can be sorted by height (elevation above sea level)
See also: List of mountains by elevation
Another notion of "height" is topographic prominence, see List of most prominent mountains, List of peaks by prominence, or Ultra-prominent peak
Yet another notion of "height" is distance of summit from the Earth's center
The notion of "highest" can be restricted to a specific geographic area
Countries can be sorted by their highest elevation
Islands can also be sorted by their highest elevation

They can be sorted by country or province.
The highest peak on each continent is called the Seven Summits
The second-highest peak on each continent is called the Seven Second Summits
The third-highest peak on each continent is called the Seven Third Summits

They can be sorted by geological origin.
They can be organized into mountain ranges.
