Bromley High School is a girls' independent school located in Bickley, Greater London. Originally located in the middle of Bromley, in 1981 it relocated to occupy new buildings set in 24 acres (97,000 m2) of grounds and playing fields.
The Good Schools Guide describes the school: "Cool calm atmosphere pervades the corridors which are lined with notice boards announcing forthcoming events and successes. General impression is of a busy and active school."


== History ==
Bromley High School was opened on 18 January 1883 and was the second school founded by the Girls' Public Day School Trust (now Girls' Day School Trust). At that time, Bromley was "a small country town, surrounded by pleasant woods and meadows". The establishment of the school marked the first public recognition in Bromley of the importance of higher education for girls.
The school celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2008. A special concert was held at the Royal Albert Hall to mark the occasion.
In 2008 a pupil in Year 11 was chosen to represent Great Britain at the opening of the Paralympic Games in Beijing.
The author Richmal Crompton was a teacher at the school from c.1917 or 1918.
