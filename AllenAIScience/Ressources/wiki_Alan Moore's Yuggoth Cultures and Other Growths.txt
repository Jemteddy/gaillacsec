Alan Moore's Yuggoth Cultures and Other Growths is a three-issue comic book miniseries presenting work written by Alan Moore. It was published by Avatar Press in 2003.


== Background ==
After Dave Mitchell of Oneiros Books asked Alan Moore to contribute to The Starry Wisdom, a collection of new writings inspired by H. P. Lovecraft, Moore came up with the idea to do an entire book, to be called Yuggoth Cultures, based on Lovecraft's Fungi From Yuggoth cycle of poems. Unfortunately, Moore lost the only copies of most of the pieces he had written for the book in a London taxi cab. Moore submitted a short story entitled "The Courtyard" as his entry for The Starry Wisdom, but suspended work on Yuggoth Cultures. "So the project went 'on hold,'...I kind of shoved in it the back of a drawer and forgot about it," he told Avatar editor-in-chief William Christensen in an interview included in Yuggoth Cultures and Other Growths No. 3. The two other surviving pieces from Yuggoth Cultures, the poems "Recognition" and "Zaman's Hill," were included in the 1995 book Dust: A Creation Books Reader.
Avatar's 2003 anthology miniseries Yuggoth Cultures and Other Growths presented Antony Johnston's comics adaptation of "Recognition" and "Zaman's Hill" as well as two of Alan Moore's songs, "Litvinoff's Book" and "Me and Dorothy Parker", the never-before-seen "Nightjar," and reprints of many of Alan Moore's short comics.

== Spin-offs ==


=== Nightjar ===
The Nightjar story was spun off into a four-part mini-series written by Johnston with art by Max Fiumara, plus a one-shot entitled Nightjar: Hollow Bones. The basis was the story as seen in Yuggoth Cultures #1 with some additional notes from Bryan Talbot, but the bulk of the story was created by Johnston.


=== Yuggoth Creatures ===
Johnston would later produce more work in the Cthulhu Mythos, for Avatar, under the title Yuggoth Creatures.
