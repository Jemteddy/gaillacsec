Wisdom Poetry refers to the type of poetry that contains some sort of moral or lesson, often written by an ancient scholar.
Wisdom Poetry has no specific beginning date or founder. It is believed to be a cultural effect, like folk ballads for example. But, poetry with a moral lesson on wisdom dates back to the Old Testament. Psalms and Proverbs are thoughts to be the base of wisdom psalms, which is interlocking with wisdom poetry.
Wisdom poetry is not a poetry branch as itself, but more so it is theme. Common names under such a theme are Rumi, and Lewis Carroll.
