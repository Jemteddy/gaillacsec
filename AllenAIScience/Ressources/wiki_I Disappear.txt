"I Disappear" is a song by American heavy metal band Metallica. The song was recorded as a contribution to the Mission: Impossible II soundtrack and reached #1 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks for seven (non-consecutive) weeks in summer 2000. It does not appear on any of Metallica's studio albums, making it the band's only standalone single. The song, which won a 2000 Metal Edge Readers' Choice Award for "Song of the Year From a Movie Soundtrack," is the last Metallica studio recording to feature bassist Jason Newsted.
The discovery of an unfinished version of the song in early 2000 on the peer-to-peer file sharing network Napster helped bring the illegal sharing of mp3 files to the spotlight, leading to the lawsuits that eventually brought down the original incarnation of Napster.

== Music videoEdit ==
The music video to the song, directed by Wayne Isham, features the members from Metallica in scenes that reference other movies. Kirk Hammett is in a desert being chased by a plane in a reference to North by Northwest. Jason Newsted is in a mansion struggling against hundreds of people that walk by him, similar to a scene in Brazil. James Hetfield is driving a car down a San Francisco hill, in a chase sequence resembling Bullitt. Lars Ulrich jumps off of an exploding building, similar to the film Die Hard. In between these scenes, the band plays together at the top of a tall rock in Monument Valley, Utah. In between these scenes, scenes featuring Tom Cruise climbing on the rock, taken from the film Mission: Impossible II are intercut. At the end of the video, Cruise reaches the top only for the band to have vanished. The car driven by Hetfield in the video is a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro; upon the video's completion, the Camaro was gifted to Hetfield. On September 22, 2003, Hetfield listed the Camaro on the auction website eBay, which later sold for more than $70,000.00.
It was the last video by the band to feature Newsted.
