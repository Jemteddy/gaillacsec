Sonnet 149 is one of 154 sonnets written by the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare.
It is considered a Dark Lady sonnet, as are all from 127 to 152.
Oddly, the first line of the sonnet is an irregular line. Unlike the next thirteen lines that fit into iambic pentameter, the first line has an odd number beats, and two strong beats in a row.
