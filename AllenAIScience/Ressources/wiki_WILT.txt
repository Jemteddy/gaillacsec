== History ==
"Gold 104" signed on in 1994 with an oldies format. The original call letters were WUOY. It used a satellite fed network oldies format with a local morning show hosted by Bob Dale. Paul Knight was the Managing Partner and General Manager. Bob Dale was Program Director. When the John Boy & Billy show was signed the station eventually evolved into a hybrid format called "Rock-Talk 'n Roll" with John Boy & Billy in the morning, The Side Show with Bob Dale mid-days and the syndicated Don & Mike Show out of Washington D.C. in the afternoons.
In May 1996, Community Broadcasting sold WUOY, WMFD and WBMS radio stations to a new company called Ocean Broadcasting. At this time, WUOY changed from 70s rock music to rock from the 60s through the 90s but kept John Boy and Billy.
For many years this station was rock WRQR "Rock 104.5". In the Fall 1997 Arbitron ratings, WRQR was the top station reaching number 1, with John Boy and Billy.
In July 2004, NextMedia Group purchased WRQR, WAZO, and WMFD from Ocean Broadcasting LLC, and WKXB and WSFM from Sea-Comm Inc. In July 2008, Capitol Broadcasting announced its purchase of NextMedia's Wilmington stations.
WRQR lost John Boy and Billy to WKXS-FM on January 1, 2007. On January 2, 2007, Two Guys Named Chris from Rock 92 in Greensboro, North Carolina began airing on WRQR, the first station other than Rock 92 to carry the show.
The Will FM variety hits format and WILT call letters moved March 31, 2008, from what is now WRMR in Jacksonville, North Carolina for a better signal in Wilmington.
The station flipped to an Adult Contemporary format on February 2, 2009.
