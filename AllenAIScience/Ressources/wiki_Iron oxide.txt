Iron oxides are chemical compounds composed of iron and oxygen. All together, there are sixteen known iron oxides and oxyhydroxides.
Iron oxides and oxide-hydroxides are widespread in nature, play an important role in many geological and biological processes, and are widely used by humans, e.g., as iron ores, pigments, catalysts, in thermite (see the diagram) and hemoglobin. Common rust is a form of iron(III) oxide. Iron oxides are widely used as inexpensive, durable pigments in paints, coatings and colored concretes. Colors commonly available are in the "earthy" end of the yellow/orange/red/brown/black range. When used as a food coloring, it has E number E172.


== OxidesEdit ==
iron(II) oxide, wüstite (FeO)
iron(II,III) oxide, magnetite (Fe3O4)
(Fe4O5)
(Fe4O3)
iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3)
alpha phase, hematite (α-Fe2O3)
beta phase, (β-Fe2O3)
gamma phase, maghemite (γ-Fe2O3)
epsilon phase, (ε-Fe2O3)


== HydroxidesEdit ==
iron(II) hydroxide (Fe(OH)2)
iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)3), (bernalite)


== Oxide/hydroxidesEdit ==

goethite (α-FeOOH),
akaganéite (β-FeOOH),
lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH),
feroxyhyte (δ-FeOOH),
ferrihydrite (Fe5HO8·4H2O approx.), or 5Fe2O3•9H2O, better recast as FeOOH•0.4H2O
high-pressure FeOOH
schwertmannite (ideally Fe8O8(OH)6(SO)·nH2O or Fe3+16O16(OH,SO4)12-13·10-12H2O)
green rust (FeIIIxFeIIy(OH)3x+2y-z(A−)z; where A− is Cl− or 0.5SO42−)


== Microbial degradationEdit ==
Several species of bacteria, including Shewanella oneidensis, Geobacter sulfurreducens and Geobacter metallireducens metabolically utilize solid iron oxides as a terminal electron acceptor, reducing Fe(III) oxides to Fe(II) containing oxides.
