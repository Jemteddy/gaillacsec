Acapulcoites are a group of the primitive achondrite class of stony meteorites.


== Naming and history ==
The acapulcoites are named after the only specimen of the group, with a witnessed fall. The Acapulca meteorite fell on 11 August 1976 at 11:00 near El Quemado Colony (16.883°N 99.9°W﻿ / 16.883; -99.9), outside Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico. It had a mass of 1,914 grams (67.5 oz). The stone was retrieved 15 minutes afterwards from a 30 centimetres (12 in) deep crater and was cool to the touch. Following that discovery 52 meteorite specimens have been classified as acapulcoites.


== Chemical composition ==
Acapulcoites are primarily composed of olivine, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, meteoric iron, and troilite.
Like all primitive achondrites, acapulcoites have chemical composition and mineralogical similarities with chondrites, some specimen even show relic chondrules. Their mineral composition lies between H and E chondrites.
