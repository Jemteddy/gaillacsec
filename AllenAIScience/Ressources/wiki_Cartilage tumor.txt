Cartilage tumors form in Cartilage tissue. They can be either benign (Chondroma) or malignant (chondrosarcoma). Frequently these tumors appear in bone, and not in pre-existing cartilage tissue. In some cases tumors that formed in other tissues may produce a cartilage-like matrix, an example of this is the pleomorphic adenoma of the sexual reproduction salivary glands.
