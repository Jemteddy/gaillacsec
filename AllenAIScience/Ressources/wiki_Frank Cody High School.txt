Frank Cody High School is a high school in Detroit, Michigan, United States. Named to honor the former Superintendent of Detroit Public Schools, it was dedicated in 1955.
Cody serves Brightmoor, the Rosedale Park Historic District, Warrendale, and a section of Old Redford. Since 2007, Cody draws students from Detroit's half of the historic Aviation subdivision.
As of 2012 there are several abandoned buildings, and Chastity Pratt Dawsey of the Detroit Free Press wrote that there were "gang fights that made the campus a tinder box".
