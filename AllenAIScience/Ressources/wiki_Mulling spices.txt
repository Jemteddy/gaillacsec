Mulling spices is a spice mixture used in drink recipes. The spices are usually used to spice hot apple cider, mulled wine, wassail, and other drinks (such as juices) during the autumn or winter. A "mulled" drink is a drink which has been prepared with these spices (usually through heating the drink in a pot with mulling spices and then strained). Mulling spices may also be added to the brewing process to make spiced beer.
The combination of spices varies, but it usually consists of cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg; and less frequently star anise, peppercorn or cardamom. It also usually includes dried fruit (such as raisins, apples or orange rind). Mulling spices can also be bought prepackaged.
