An instant cold pack is a device that consists of two bags; one containing water, inside a bag containing ammonium nitrate, calcium ammonium nitrate or urea. When the inner bag of water is broken by squeezing the package, it is allowed to dissolve the solid in an endothermic reaction. This reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings, quickly lowering the pack's temperature.
Instant cold packs are a convenient direct replacement for crushed ice used as first aid on sport injuries, and can be carried as first aid to remote or wilderness areas where ice is unavailable.
For safety reasons, instant cold packs have recently been developed without ammonium nitrate, but some companies still use ammonium nitrate.
