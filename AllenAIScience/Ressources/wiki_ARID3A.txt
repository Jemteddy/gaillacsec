AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 3A is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ARID3A gene.


== Function ==
This gene encodes a member of the ARID (AT-rich interaction domain) family of DNA binding proteins. It was found by homology to the Drosophila dead ringer gene, which is important for normal embryogenesis. Other ARID family members have roles in embryonic patterning, cell lineage gene regulation, cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation, and possibly in chromatin structure modification.


== Interactions ==
ARID3A has been shown to interact with:
BTK, and
E2F1
