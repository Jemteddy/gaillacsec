There are probably a few thousand astronomical objects named after people. These include the names of a few thousand asteroids and hundreds of comets. Also, many topological features on solar system bodies have been named after people, including many hundreds of craters on the Moon, Mars and other planets and satellites. In addition to craters there are also various other topological features such as mountains, valleys, ridges on the Moon and other bodies which are also named after people. Finally, a very few stars are named after people (according to the IAU), such as Barnard's star. Thus this list is somewhat incomplete. (Star-registry companies keep lists of stars they claim to have named after people. The IAU does not recognize those claims.)
The list does not include astronomical objects named after mythological or fictional characters.
