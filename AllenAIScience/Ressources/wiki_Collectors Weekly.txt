Collectors Weekly is an online resource for those interested in antiques and vintage items. It has been described as an "online encyclopedia about all things antique." It aims to appeal to collectors from all over the world, whatever their interests or experience.
The resource is published by a San Francisco-based company run by Dave Margulius, who himself is an avid collector. Collectors Weekly has hundreds of categories of items, each with a written description known as an "Overview." The site also has a "Show & Tell" section where they can showcase items they collect. In addition, Collectors Weekly writers publish articles that are sometimes long-form interviews with antiques experts, and other times blog-style posts.
