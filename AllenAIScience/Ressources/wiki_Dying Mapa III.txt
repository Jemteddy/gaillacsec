Dying Mapa III is an album by the Japanese noise band Merzbow, then consisting of Masami Akita and Kiyoshi Mizutani. This is the third installment of the Dying Mapa trilogy inspired by the Nyingmapa school of Tibetan Buddhism.
Musically, the whole trilogy is made with different equipment and instruments than other recordings of the same period. It also features instruments recorded on tape and then either slowed down or played backwards.
The album was later included on the 50-CD box set Merzbox on CD 16 along with the second half of Dying Mapa II.
