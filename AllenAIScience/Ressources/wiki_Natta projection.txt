The Natta projection is a way to depict molecules with complete stereochemistry in two dimensions in a skeletal formula. This concept is named after Giulio Natta. In a hydrocarbon molecule with all carbon atoms making up the backbone in a tetrahedral molecular geometry, the zigzag backbone is in the paper plane with the substituents either sticking out of the paper (chemical bond depicted triangular in bold) or retreating into the paper (chemical bond depicted triangular in stripe pattern). The Natta projection is useful for representing the tacticity of a polymer.
