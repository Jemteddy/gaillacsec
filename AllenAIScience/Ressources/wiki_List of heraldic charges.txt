This is a list of heraldic charges. It does not cover those charges which are geometrical patterns and resemble partitions of the field; for these, see Ordinary (heraldry).

A few simple charges are traditionally, and arbitrarily, classified among the so called subordinaries. (All other mobile charges are called common charges.)

fusil (a narrow lozenge)
mascle (lozenge voided)
rustre (lozenge pierced)
billet
annulet;
roundel, but different tinctures have different names: for example roundels argent are called plates. A roundel barry wavy azure and argent is called a fountain.
label is commonly a mark of difference, but also appears as an independent charge.
