Olive skin is a human skin color spectrum. It is often associated with pigmentation in the Type IV to Type V range of the Fitzpatrick scale. It generally refers to light brown or brownish skin, and it is often described as having greenish or yellowish undertones.
Type IV coloration is frequent among populations from the Mediterranean and parts of Central America and South America. It corresponds with moderate brown, typical Mediterranean skin tones. This skin tone rarely burns and tans easily.
Type V coloration is frequent among populations from the Middle East, the Mediterranean, parts of Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. It corresponds with dark brown, Middle Eastern skin tones. This skin tone is minimally reactive to ultraviolet radiation, rarely or very rarely burns, and tans quite easily.
