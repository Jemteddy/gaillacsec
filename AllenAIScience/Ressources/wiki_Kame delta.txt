A kame delta (or ice-contact delta, morainic delta) is a glacial landform made by a stream flowing through and around glacial ice and depositing material as a kame (stratified sequence of sediments) upon entering a lake or pond at the end or terminus of the glacier, thus "in front" of it, a proglacial lake. It is distinctive because it has been sorted by the action of the stream. This sorting is responsible for the stratified layers of silt, sand and gravel at the ice margin which create the delta. This landform may often be observed after the glacier has melted and the delta (in the sense of the Greek letter) or triangular shape is visible. Often upon melting of the glacier the edges of the delta may subside as ice under it melts and glacial till may be deposited in the lateral or side area also as material is deposited from the melting glacier.
The Fonthill Kame Delta is the highest point in the Niagara Peninsula region.
