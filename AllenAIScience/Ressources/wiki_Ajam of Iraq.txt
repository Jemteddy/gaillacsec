Ajam of Iraq are Iraqi citizens of Iranian national background or descent. Iranians have a long presence as a minority in Iraq, dating back to antiquity.
Saddam Hussein deported most Iraqi Ajam in the 1970s and 1980s.


== History ==
In the 1970s, Saddam Hussein deported between 350,000 to 650,000 Shia Iraqis of Iranian ancestry (Ajam). Most of them went to Iran. Those who could prove an Iranian ancestry in Iran's court received Iranian citizenship (400,000) and some of them returned to Iraq after Saddam.


== Culture ==
Persians in Iraq do not segregate themselves as an ethnic minority, but they integrate with the Iraqi society. Iraqi Persians belong to Twelver Shīʿa Islam – the same religion, sect, and school that most Iraqis belong to.
