Kneeler is a piece of furniture used for resting in a kneeling position.


== Prayer kneeler ==
Also called a kneeling rail. In many churches, pews are equipped with kneelers in front of the seating bench so members of the congregation can kneel on them instead of the floor. In a few other situations such as confessionals and areas in front of an altar, kneelers for kneeling during prayer or sacraments may also be used.
A kneeler is also a part of the prie-dieu prayer desk.
