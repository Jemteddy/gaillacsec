Stephen James Smith (born 22 July 1951) is a former England international rugby union player. In 1980 he played in all four matches in England's Grand Slam victory and was called up as a replacement to the 1980 British Lions tour to South Africa but did not play a game; he sat on the bench for the final international. He became a full-fledged Lion on the 1983 British Lions tour to New Zealand when joining the tour as a replacement for the injured Nigel Melville. He played club rugby for Sale and was on the winning team at the Glengarth Sevens whilst playing for Loughborough University.
In 1987 he founded the Cotton Traders clothing business with his former club and national teammate Fran Cotton. In 2008 Cotton Traders was forced to pull out of Burma after an investigation by the Burma Campaign UK uncovered the company was sourcing clothing from Burma.
Steve Smith was employed by ITV as a co-commentator with John Taylor of the Rugby World Cup, from 1991 to 2003. He was co-commentator to Taylor when England won the World Cup Final in 2003.
