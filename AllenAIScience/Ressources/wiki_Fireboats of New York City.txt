As one of the busiest ports in the world authorities have long maintained a fleet of Fireboats of New York City. For much of the late 19th and early 20th Century, New York City maintained a fleet of ten fireboats.
In recent decades technology has improved to where smaller boats can provide the pumping capacity that required a large boat in the past. These smaller boats require smaller crews, and the crews themselves require less training. Like many other cities the FDNY operates a fleet with a smaller number of large fireboats, supplemented by a number of unnamed boats in the 10 meter range.
