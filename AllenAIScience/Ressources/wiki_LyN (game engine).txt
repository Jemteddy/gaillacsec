LyN engine is a video game engine developed by Ubisoft. It's designed to effectively scale on both old-gen and newer-generation hardware. The first game released featuring this engine was Rabbids Go Home and will serve many forthcoming games. For the Wii in particular, it maximizes the console's graphical capabilities without limiting the imaginations of the developers using it.
