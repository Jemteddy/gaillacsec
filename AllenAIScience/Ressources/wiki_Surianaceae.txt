The Surianaceae are a family of plants in the order Fabales. It has an unusual distribution: the genus Recchia is native to Mexico, and the sole member of Suriana, S. maritima, is a coastal plant with a pantropical distribution; and the remaining three genera are endemic to Australia.
They range in form from small shrubs to tall trees.
