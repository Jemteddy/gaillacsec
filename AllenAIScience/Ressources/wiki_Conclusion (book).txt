In a non-fiction book, a Conclusion is an ending section which states the concluding ideas and concepts of the preceding writing. This generally follows the body or perhaps an Afterword, and the conclusion may be followed by an Epilogue, Outro, Postscript, Appendix/Addendum, Glossary, Bibliography, Index, Errata, or a Colophon.
