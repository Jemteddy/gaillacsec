Thus, a terrible war breaks out between the eight animal tribes over the powerful Chi, a substance that can both sustain life and destroy it. At the final battle, since Crooler has run out of Persuader Plants and Laval fakes his death, Cragger is emotionally moved and apologizes for everything he has done.

In order to stop them, the Phoenix used eight ancient artifacts to produce the "Illumination" which reverted Chima to a primordial state and trapped the Ice Hunters in the Gorge of Eternal Depth in ice.
