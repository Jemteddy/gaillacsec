Teide 1 was the first brown dwarf to be verified, in 1995. It is located in the Pleiades open star cluster, approximately 400 light-years (120 pc) from Earth.
The apparent magnitude of this faint object is 17.76, which is so faint that it can only seen in large amateur or bigger telescopes. Its absolute magnitude is 12.38.
This object is more massive than a planet (55 ± 15 MJ), but less massive than a star (0.052 MSun). The radius of the brown dwarf is about that of Jupiter (or one-tenth that of the Sun). Its surface temperature is 2600 ± 150 K, which is about half that of the Sun. Its luminosity is 0.08–0.05% of that of the Sun. Its age is only 120 million years compared to the Sun's age of 4.6 billion years.
This brown dwarf is hot enough to fuse lithium in its core, but not hot enough to fuse hydrogen like the Sun.
