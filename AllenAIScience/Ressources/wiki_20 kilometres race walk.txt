The 20 kilometre race walk is an Olympic athletics event that is competed by both men and women. The racewalking event is competed as a road race. Athletes must always keep in contact with the ground and the supporting leg must remain straight until the raised leg passes it. (20 kilometres is 12.4274 miles)


== World records ==

The men's world record for the 20 km race walk is held by Yusuke Suzuki, who walked 1:16:36 at the Asian Race Walking Championships in his home town of Nomi, Japan. Suzuki's new World Record came exactly one week after Yohann Diniz's mark who walked a then record time of 1:17:02 in Arles at the 2015 French championships. The women's world record of 1:25:02 was set by Elena Lashmanova, who is currently serving a ban for doping, at the 2012 London Olympics. There are several performances superior to Lashmanova's official record that have never been ratified. On February 27, 2015, Elmira Alembekova bettered the time to 1:24:47 at the Russian Race Walking Championships in Sochi, Russia. That mark is currently pending.
