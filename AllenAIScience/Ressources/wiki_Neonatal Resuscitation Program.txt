The Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) is an educational program in neonatal resuscitation that was developed and is maintained by the American Academy of Pediatrics. This program focuses on basic resuscitation skills for newly born infants.
With the rollout of the sixth edition of NRP to reflect the 2010 American Heart Association guidelines for resuscitation, the course format has changed considerably. In the past, a full-day course incorporated lecture, written testing and hands-on skills. Now students study independently, complete an online examination, then attend an in-person skills session. This reduces the classroom time required for the course and allows instructors to focus on the practical skills needed to resuscitate the neonate.
The program is intended for healthcare providers who perform resuscitation in the delivery room or newborn nursery. Providers who take NRP are diverse in their scope of practice. The course outline is flexible to allow providers to complete specific modules directly related to their practice.
