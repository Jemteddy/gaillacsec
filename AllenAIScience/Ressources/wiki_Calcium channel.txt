A calcium channel is an ion channel which displays selective permeability to calcium ions. It is sometimes synonymous as voltage-dependent calcium channel, although there are also ligand-gated calcium channels.


== Comparison tablesEdit ==
The following tables explain gating, gene, location and function of different types of calcium channels, both voltage and ligand-gated.

== PharmacologyEdit ==
L-type Calcium channel blockers are used to treat hypertension.
