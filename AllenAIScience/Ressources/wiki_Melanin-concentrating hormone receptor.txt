Two Melanin-concentrating hormone receptors (MCHR) have recently been characterized: MCH-R1 and MCH-R2. These two receptors share approximately 38% homology.
MCH-R1 is expressed in all mammals.
MCH-R2 is only found in some primates and carnivores including dogs, ferrets and man.


== Clinical significance ==
Antagonists might be useful in the treatment of obesity and anxiety and depression. An agonist might have possible utility as a treatment for osteoporosis and insomnia
Research is ongoing for antagonists affecting MCH receptors R1 and R2.
