Shui Jin Gui (simplified Chinese: 水金龟; traditional Chinese: 水金龜) is a very characteristic Wuyi Oolong tea, whose name literally means Golden Marine Turtle. The tea produces a bright green color when steeped and is much greener than most other Wuyi Oolong teas. It is one of the four famous bushes of Wuyi, a Si Da Ming Cong.
