Mallee Woodlands and Shrublands (MVG 14) is a Major Vegetation Group which occurs in semi-arid areas of southern Australia. The vegetation is dominated by mallee eucalypts which are rarely over 6 metres high. Other dominant plant genera are Melaleuca, Acacia and Hakea.
The composition of the understorey depends on factors such as rainfall, soil composition as well as fire frequency and intensity. In subhumid areas, a variety of grasses and shrubs predominate, while in semi-arid areas hummock grasses (Triodia species) predominate.
In 2001, the area covered by this vegetation group was estimated to be 65% of its pre 1788 coverage. The most extensive extant area of this group in Australia today is found in the Great Victoria Desert. Prior to 1788, the largest area occurred in the Murray-Darling basin.
The Major Vegetation Subgroups for this group are:
Mallee with hummock grass
Mallee with a dense shrubby understorey
Mallee with an open shrubby understorey
Mallee with a tussock grass understorey.
