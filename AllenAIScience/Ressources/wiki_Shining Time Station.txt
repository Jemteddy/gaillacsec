Shining Time Station is an American children's television series jointly created by Britt Allcroft and Rick Siggelkow. The series was produced by The Britt Allcroft Company and Quality Family Entertainment in New York for New York City PBS Station WNET, and was originally taped in New York City and later in Toronto. It incorporated sequences from the British TV show Thomas & Friends, which was in turn based on a series of books that had been written by the Reverend "W." (for Wilbert) Awdry. The series aired on PBS from January 29, 1989 to June 11, 1993, and aired re-runs until June 11, 1998. It aired on Fox Family from 1998 to 1999. It also aired on Nick Jr. in 2000 and on Canadian TV networks such as APTN and SCN. Elements from the show were incorporated into the Thomas the Tank Engine film Thomas and the Magic Railroad.


== BackgroundEdit ==
After the success of Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends in the United Kingdom, Britt Allcroft and her production company teamed up with PBS Station WNET in New York to produce and distribute the sitcom-esque Shining Time Station, every episode of which would include a couple of episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. The series starred Ringo Starr, George Carlin, Didi Conn, Brian O'Connor, The Flexitoon Puppets, and Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. Ringo Starr, who had already been providing the voice of the storyteller for the British series, agreed to extend the role to include the on-screen character called Mr. Conductor in Shining Time Station. He later left the show and was replaced by George Carlin.
Shining Time Station received critical acclaim. In a review for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker states that, compared to the faster paced Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?, "'Shining Time Station' wants to slow things down; it's an old-fashioned show that creates a gentle, lulling atmosphere to convince children that life is fun and that trains are the way to travel." It was a ratings success as well. In its first season, the show averaged a 0.9 Nielsen rating, translating to about 1.2 million viewers on average. At the peak of its popularity, the show brought in up to 7.5 million viewers per week.


== OverviewEdit ==
The Shining Time Station is a train station on the Indian Valley Railroad. It is managed by Stacy Jones. Its workshop is run in the first season by Harry Cupper, and thereafter by Billy Twofeathers. A local named Horace Schemer runs the station's arcade and serves as the series's comic relief. The narrative is driven by regular and incidental visitors to the station.
Mr. Conductor is a tiny man who lives in a signal house inside the station's mural and tells the stories of "Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends" to the kids.
