Kori rotti is a popular spicy Coastal Karnataka dish, a combination of red-chili based chicken curry and crisp dry wafers (about 1mm thick) made from boiled rice. This is somewhat similar to the Arabic dish tashreeb, the crispy hubz (similar to pita bread) seasoned in bland thin chicken or mutton gravy.
Kori rotti is a traditional dish of the Tuluvas (Tulu-speaking people) and served at weddings, parties and special occasions. Almost all restaurants in the area of Udupi and Mangalore serve this food.
