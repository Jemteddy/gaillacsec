A semi-synchronous orbit is an orbit with a period equal to half the average rotational period of the body being orbited, and in the same direction as that body's rotation.
For Earth, a semi-synchronous orbit is considered a medium Earth orbit, with a period of just under 12 hours. For circular orbits, the altitude is approximately 20,200 km.
