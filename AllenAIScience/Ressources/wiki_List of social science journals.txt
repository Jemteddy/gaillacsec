The following is a partial list of social science journals, including history and area studies. There are thousands of academic journals covering the social sciences in publication, and many more have been published at various points in the past. The list given here is far from exhaustive, and contains the most influential, currently publishing journals in each field. As a rule of thumb, each field should be represented by at most ten positions, chosen by their impact factors and other ratings.
Note: there are many important academic magazines that are not true peer-reviewed journals. They are not listed here.
For a list of periodicals in the physical, life, and applied sciences, see List of scientific journals.
