A tick infestation is a condition where a tick acts as an ectoparasite.
It is sometimes thought of as an animal disease. In humans, the primary concern from tick bites is often not the ectoparasitism itself, but the potential for the tick to transmit disease or tick paralysis. Still, in certain populations, it is possible for tick infestation to be clinically significant.
There is some evidence that Ixodes ricinus infected with Borrelia burgdorferi may become more efficient at infestation.
Home remedies (such as vaseline or matches) have been used in the past, but are not currently recommended.
