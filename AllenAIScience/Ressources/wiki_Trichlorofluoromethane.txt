Trichlorofluoromethane, also called freon-11, CFC-11, or R-11, is a chlorofluorocarbon. It is a colorless, faint ethereal and sweetish odor liquid that boils at about room temperature.


== Uses ==
It was the first widely used refrigerant. Because of its high boiling point (compared to most refrigerants), it can be used in systems with a low operating pressure, making the mechanical design of such systems less demanding than that of higher-pressure refrigerants R-12 or R-22.
R-11 is assigned an ozone depletion potential of 1.0. U.S. production was ended in January 1, 1996.
Trichlorofluoromethane is used as a reference compound for fluorine-19 NMR studies.
Prior to the knowledge of the ozone depletion potential of chlorine in refrigerants and other possible harmful effects on the environment, trichlorofluoromethane was sometimes used as a cleaning/rinsing agent for low pressure systems.
