James Watson Webb III (known as James Jr.) (January 9, 1916 – June 10, 2000) was an American film editor and heir to both the Havemeyer and Vanderbilt families.


== Biography ==
He was born in Syosset, New York, to James Watson Webb II of the Vanderbilt family and Electra Havemeyer. His siblings were Electra (1910–1982), Samuel (1912–1988), Lila (1913–1961) and Harry (1922–1975).
He attended Groton School and Yale University from which he graduated in 1938. In 1946 he began work in California as an apprentice film editor at 20th-Century Fox. In 1949, after a meeting with Darryl F. Zanuck, he was promoted to assistant film cutter. He eventually became Zanuck's head film cutter. He was also reported as being involved in the founding the American Cinema Editors. 
Webb was the editor of numerous films including A Letter to Three Wives, The Razor's Edge with Tyrone Power, Wing and a Prayer, State Fair, With a Song in My Heart, Call Northside 777 and Cheaper by the Dozen. Webb retired from film editing in 1952; Barbara McLean, his boss, promoted Hugh S. Fowler to replace him.
Webb served as the President of the Shelburne Museum from 1960 until 1977 and then became Chairman of the Board of Directors until 1996. Watson resigned from the Board that year in a dispute over deaccessioning of an estimated $25-million worth of the museum's Impressionist collection which his mother had given to the museum.
He died in Los Angeles, California, on June 10, 2000.
