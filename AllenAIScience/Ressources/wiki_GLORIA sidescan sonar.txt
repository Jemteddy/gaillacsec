The GLORIA sidescan sonar is a side-scan sonar system for determining the topography of the ocean floor. GLORIA stands for Geological Long Range Inclined Asdic.
Like most side-scan sonars, the GLORIA instrument is towed behind a ship. GLORIA has a ping rate of two per minute, and detects returns from a range of up to 22 km either side of the sonar fish.
