== Pitching style ==
Pauley is a sinkerball pitcher, and as such his success relies on his ability to keep the ball down in the strike zone, and when contact is made, to get ground-ball outs. Pauley also has the standard fastball, curveball, and changeup in his repertoire. His fastball hits the high 80 MPH range and his curveball has more of a sweeping motion than the standard 12-to-6 movement seen from most minor-league pitchers.
