In each episode of "Take This House and Sell It" a designer is chosen to visit a family or couple's home that is having trouble selling. He or she makes comments before meeting with the home owners. Once meeting with the homeowners, the designer humorously criticizes the home owner's home and then dispatches their crew, which includes a painter, a contractor, a handyman and seamstress, and in less than 2 days prepare for a "last chance open house". The designer and crew work hard to give the homeowner's home a good impression in order to get a sale. The show then reveals if the homeowener sold their house or not
