In statistics, the inverse Wishart distribution, also called the inverted Wishart distribution, is a probability distribution defined on real-valued positive-definite matrices. In Bayesian statistics it is used as the conjugate prior for the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution.
We say  follows an inverse Wishart distribution, denoted as , if its inverse  has a Wishart distribution . Important identities have been derived for Inverse-Wishart distribution.


== Density ==
The probability density function of the inverse Wishart is:

where  and  are  positive definite matrices, and Γp(·) is the multivariate gamma function.


== Theorems ==


=== Distribution of the inverse of a Wishart-distributed matrix ===
If  and  is of size , then  has an inverse Wishart distribution  .


=== Marginal and conditional distributions from an inverse Wishart-distributed matrix ===
Suppose  has an inverse Wishart distribution. Partition the matrices  and  conformably with each other

where  and  are  matrices, then we have
i)  is independent of  and , where  is the Schur complement of  in ;
ii) ;
iii) , where  is a matrix normal distribution;
iv) , where ;


=== Conjugate distribution ===
Suppose we wish to make inference about a covariance matrix  whose prior  has a  distribution. If the observations  are independent p-variate Gaussian variables drawn from a  distribution, then the conditional distribution  has a  distribution, where .
Because the prior and posterior distributions are the same family, we say the inverse Wishart distribution is conjugate to the multivariate Gaussian.
Due to its conjugacy to the multivariate Gaussian, it is possible to marginalize out (integrate out) the Gaussian's parameter .

(this is useful because the variance matrix  is not known in practice, but because  is known a priori, and  can be obtained from the data, the right hand side can be evaluated directly). The inverse-Wishart distribution as a prior can be constructed via existing transferred prior knowledge.


=== Moments ===
The following is based on Press, S. J. (1982) "Applied Multivariate Analysis", 2nd ed. (Dover Publications, New York), after reparameterizing the degree of freedom to be consistent with the p.d.f. definition above.
The mean:

The variance of each element of :

The variance of the diagonal uses the same formula as above with , which simplifies to:

The covariance of elements of  are given by:


== Related distributions ==
A univariate specialization of the inverse-Wishart distribution is the inverse-gamma distribution. With  (i.e. univariate) and ,  and  the probability density function of the inverse-Wishart distribution becomes

i.e., the inverse-gamma distribution, where  is the ordinary Gamma function.
A generalization is the inverse multivariate gamma distribution.
Another generalization has been termed the generalized inverse Wishart distribution, . A  positive definite matrix  is said to be distributed as  if  is distributed as . Here  denotes the symmetric matrix square root of , the parameters  are  positive definite matrices, and the parameter  is a positive scalar larger than . Note that when  is equal to an identity matrix, . This generalized inverse Wishart distribution has been applied to estimating the distributions of multivariate autoregressive processes.
A different type of generalization is the normal-inverse-Wishart distribution, essentially the product of a multivariate normal distribution with an inverse Wishart distribution.
