The SIAI-Marchetti S.210 was a 1970s Italian twin-engined cabin-monoplane designed and built by SIAI-Marchetti as a development of the single-engined SIAI-Marchetti S.205.


== DevelopmentEdit ==
The S.210 was developed from the single-engined S.205 and was an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane with a retractable tricycle landing gear. It was powered by two 200 hp (149 kW) Avco Lycoming TIO-360-A1B engines, one mounted on the leading edge of each wing. It had three pairs of side-by-side seats for one pilot and five passengers. The prototype first flew on 18 February 1970 and this was followed by an improved second prototype with increased baggage capacity and enlarged rear windows. A production batch of ten aircraft were built based on the second prototype.
