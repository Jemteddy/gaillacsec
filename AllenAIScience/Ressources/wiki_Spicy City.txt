== Reception ==
The series premiered in July 1997, beating South Park to television by over a month and becoming the first "adults only" cartoon series.
Although critical reaction was mixed and largely unfavorable, Spicy City received acceptable ratings. The Los Angeles Times called the series "Adolescent Humor for Adults" The Dallas Morning News said the series "exploits the female form".
A second season was approved, but the network wanted to fire Bakshi's writing team and hire professional Los Angeles screenwriters. When Bakshi refused to cooperate with the network, the series was cancelled.
